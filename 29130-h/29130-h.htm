conditions or imagine situations.
The life of <i>any</i> lad of Billy
Topsail&#8217;s years up there is sufficiently
romantic. It is this skill in the portrayal
of actual conditions that lie
ready to the hand of the intelligent
observer that makes Mr. Duncan&#8217;s
Newfoundland stories so noteworthy.
&#8216;The Adventures of Billy
Topsail&#8217; is a wonderful book.&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;<i>Brooklyn

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Jimmie Grimm, Not Being Able to Help It, Is Born At
Buccaneer Cove, Much to His Surprise, and Tog, the Wolf-Dog,
Feels the Lash of a Seal-hide Whip and Conceives an Enmity</i></p>
<p>Young Jimmie Grimm began life at Buccaneer
Cove of the Labrador. It was a
poor place to begin, of course; but Jimmie
had had nothing to do with that. It was by
Tog, with the eager help of two hungry gray
wolves, that he was taught to take care of the life
into which, much to his surprise, he had been
ushered. Tog was a dog with a bad name;
and everybody knows that a dog with a bad
name should be hanged forthwith. It should have
happened to Tog. At best he was a wolfish
beast. His father was a wolf; and in the end
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Tog was as lean and savage and cunningly
treacherous as any wolf of the gray forest packs.
When he had done with Jimmie Grimm&ndash;&ndash;and
when Jimmie Grimm&#8217;s father had done with Tog&ndash;&ndash;Jimmie
Grimm had learned a lesson that he
never could recall without a gasp and a quick
little shudder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I jus&#8217; don&#8217;t like t&#8217; think o&#8217; Tog,&#8221; he told Billy
Topsail and Archie Armstrong, long afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t <i>afraid</i> of him, were you?&#8221;
Archie Armstrong demanded, a bit scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Was</i> I?&#8221; Jimmie snorted. &#8220;Huh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The business with Tog happened before old
Jim Grimm moved south to Ruddy Cove of
the Newfoundland coast, disgusted with the fishing
of Buccaneer. It was before Jimmie Grimm
had fallen in with Billy Topsail and Donald
North, before he had ever clapped eyes on Bagg,
the London gutter-snipe, or had bashfully pawed
the gloved hand of Archie Armstrong, Sir
Archibald&#8217;s son. It was before Donald North
cured himself of fear and the <i>First Venture</i> had
broken into a blaze in a gale of wind off the
Chunks. It was before Billy Topsail, a lad of
wits, had held a candle over the powder barrel,
when the wreckers boarded the <i>Spot Cash</i>. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
was before Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had been rescued
from a Miquelon jail and the <i>Heavenly Home</i>
was cut out of St. Pierre Harbour in the foggy
night.</p>
<p>It was also before the <i>Spot Cash</i> had fallen foul
of the plot to scuttle the <i>Black Eagle</i>. It was before
the big gale and all the adventures of that
northward trading voyage. In short, it was before
Jim Grimm moved up from the Labrador
to Ruddy Cove for better fishing.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Tog had a bad name. On the Labrador coast
all dogs have bad names; nor, if the truth must
be told, does the reputation do them any injustice.
If evil communications corrupt good
manners, the desperate character of Tog&#8217;s deeds,
no less than the tragic manner of his end, may
be accounted for. At any rate, long before his
abrupt departure from the wilderness trails and
snow-covered rock of Buccaneer Cove, he had
earned the worst reputation of all the pack.</p>
<p>It began in the beginning. When Tog was
eight weeks old his end was foreseen. He was
then little more than a soft, fluffy, black-and-white
ball, awkwardly perambulating on four
absurdly bowed legs. Martha, Jim Grimm&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
wife, one day cast the lean scraps of the midday
meal to the pack. What came to pass so
amazed old Jim Grimm that he dropped his
splitting-knife and stared agape.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; would you look at that little beast!&#8221; he
gasped. &#8220;That one&#8217;s a wonder for badness!&#8221;</p>
<p>The snarling, scrambling heap of dogs, apparently
inextricably entangled, had all at once been
reduced to order. Instead of a confusion of taut
legs and teeth and bristling hair, there was a
precise half-circle of gaunt beasts, squatted at a
respectful distance from Tog&#8217;s mother, hopelessly
licking their chops, while, with hair on end and
fangs exposed and dripping, she kept them off.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t Jinny,&#8221; Jim remarked. &#8220;You can&#8217;t
blame she. It&#8217;s that little pup with the black
eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>You couldn&#8217;t blame Jenny. Last of all would
it occur to Martha Grimm, with a child of her own
to rear, to call her in the wrong. With a litter of
five hearty pups to provide for, Jenny was animated
by a holy maternal instinct. But Tog,
which was the one with the black eye, was not to
be justified. He was imitating his mother&#8217;s
tactics with diabolical success. A half-circle of
whimpering puppies, keeping a respectful distance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
watched in grieved surprise, while, with
hair on end and tiny fangs occasionally exposed,
he devoured the scraps of the midday meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;A wonder for badness!&#8221; Jim Grimm repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Give a dog a bad name,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Martha,
quick, like the woman she was, to resent snap-judgment
of the young, &#8220;&#8216;an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hang un,&#8217;&#8221; Jim concluded. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be s&#8217;prised if it <i>did</i> come t&#8217;
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It did.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>In Tog&#8217;s eyes there was never the light of love
and humour&ndash;&ndash;no amiable jollity. He would come
fawning, industriously wagging his hinder parts,
like puppies of more favoured degree; but all
the while his black eyes were alert, hard, infinitely
suspicious and avaricious. Not once, I
am sure, did affection or gratitude lend them
beauty. A beautiful pup he was, nevertheless&ndash;&ndash;fat
and white, awkwardly big, his body promising
splendid strength. Even when he made war
on the fleas&ndash;&ndash;and he waged it unceasingly&ndash;&ndash;the
vigour and skill of attack, the originality of
method, gave him a certain distinction. But his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
eyes were never well disposed; the pup was
neither trustful nor to be trusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he lives t&#8217; the age o&#8217; three,&#8221; said Jim
Grimm, with a pessimistic wag of the head,
&#8220;&#8217;twill be more by luck than good conduct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, dad,&#8221; said Jimmie Grimm, &#8220;you jus&#8217;
leave un t&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jimmie,&#8221; drawled Jim Grimm, &#8220;it
might teach you more about dogs than you know.
I don&#8217;t mind if I <i>do</i> leave un t&#8217; you&ndash;&ndash;for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hut!&#8221; Jimmie boasted. &#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> master un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May <i>be</i>,&#8221; said Jim Grimm.</p>
<p>It was Jimmie Grimm who first put Tog in the
traces. This was in the early days of Tog&#8217;s first
winter&ndash;&ndash;and of Jimmie&#8217;s seventh. The dog was
a lusty youngster then; better nourished than
the other dogs of Jim Grimm&#8217;s pack, no more
because of greater strength and daring than a
marvellous versatility in thievery. In a bored
sort of way, being at the moment lazy with food
stolen from Sam Butt&#8217;s stage, Tog submitted.
He yawned, stretched his long legs, and gave inopportune
attention to a persistent flea near the
small of his back. When, however, the butt of
Jimmie&#8217;s whip fell smartly on his flank, he was
surprised into an appreciation of the fact that a
serious attempt was being made to curtail his
freedom; and he was at once alive with resentful
protest.</p>

TOG THAWED INTO LIMP AND SERVILE AMIABILITY.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Tog!&#8221; Jimmie complained. &#8220;Bide
still!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tog slipped from Jimmie&#8217;s grasp and bounded
off. He turned with a snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Tog!&#8221; cried Jimmie.</p>
<p>Tog came&ndash;&ndash;stepping warily over the snow.
His head was low, his king-hairs bristling, his
upper lip lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, Tog, b&#8217;y!&#8221; said Jimmie, ingratiatingly.</p>
<p>Tog thawed into limp and servile amiability.
The long, wiry white hair of his neck fell flat;
he wagged his bushy white tail; he pawed the
snow and playfully tossed his long, pointed nose
as he crept near. But had Jimmie Grimm been
more observant, more knowing, he would have
perceived that the light in the lanky pup&#8217;s eyes
had not mellowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good dog!&#8221; crooned Jimmie, stretching out
an affectionate hand.</p>
<p>Vanished, then, in a flash, every symptom of
Tog&#8217;s righteousness. His long teeth closed on
Jimmie&#8217;s small hand with a snap. Jimmie struck
instantly&ndash;&ndash;and struck hard. The butt of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
whip caught Tog on the nose. He dropped the
hand and leaped away with a yelp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, me b&#8217;y,&#8221; thought Jimmie Grimm, staring
into the quivering dog&#8217;s eyes, not daring to
glance at his own dripping hand, &#8220;I&#8217;ll master
<i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>But it was no longer a question of mastery.
The issue was life or death. Tog was now of
an age to conceive murder. Moreover, he was
of a size to justify an attempt upon Jimmie.
And murder was in his heart. He crouched,
quivering, his wolfish eyes fixed upon the boy&#8217;s
blazing blue ones. For a moment neither antagonist
ventured attack. Both waited.</p>
<p>It was Jimmie who lost patience. He swung
his long dog whip. The lash cracked in Tog&#8217;s
face. With a low growl, the dog rushed, and
before the boy could evade the attack, the dog
had him by the leg. Down came the butt of the
whip. Tog released his hold and leaped out of
reach. He pawed about, snarling, shaking his
bruised head.</p>
<p>This advantage the boy sought to pursue.
He advanced&ndash;&ndash;alert, cool, ready to strike. Tog
retreated. Jimmie rushed upon him. At a
bound, Tog passed, turned, and came again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
Before Jimmie had well faced him, Tog had
leaped for his throat. Down went the boy, overborne
by the dog&#8217;s weight, and by the impact,
which he was not prepared to withstand. But
Tog was yet a puppy, unpracticed in fight; he
had missed the grip. And a heavy stick, in the
hands of Jimmie&#8217;s father, falling mercilessly upon
him, put him in yelping retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low, Jimmie,&#8221; drawled Jim Grimm, while
he helped the boy to his feet, &#8220;that that dog <i>is</i>
teachin&#8217; you more &#8217;n you knowed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low, dad,&#8221; replied the breathless Jimmie,
&#8220;that he teached me nothin&#8217; more than I forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t forget again,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>Jimmie did not deign to reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Jimmie Grimm is Warned Not to Fall Down, and Tog,
Confirmed in Bad Ways, Raids Ghost Tickle, Commits Murder, Runs
With the Wolves, Plots the Death of Jimmie Grimm and Reaches the
End of His Rope</i></p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm&#8217;s father broke Tog to the
traces before the winter was over. A
wretched time the perverse beast had of
it. Labrador dogs are not pampered idlers; in
winter they must work or starve&ndash;&ndash;as must men,
the year round. But Tog had no will for work,
acknowledged no master save the cruel, writhing
whip; and the whip was therefore forever
flecking his ears or curling about his flanks.
Moreover, he was a sad shirk. Thus he made
more trouble for himself. When his team-mates
discovered the failing&ndash;&ndash;and this was immediately&ndash;&ndash;they
pitilessly worried his hind legs. Altogether,
in his half-grown days, Tog led a yelping,
bleeding life of it; whereby he got no more
than his desserts.</p>
<p>Through the summer he lived by theft when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
thievery was practicable; at other times he went
fishing for himself with an ill will. Meantime,
he developed strength and craft, both in extraordinary
degree. There was not a more successful
criminal in the pack, nor was there a more
despicable bully. When the first snow fell, Tog
was master at Buccaneer Cove, and had already
begun to raid the neighbouring settlement at
Ghost Tickle. Twice he was known to have
adventured there. After the first raid, he licked
his wounds in retirement for two weeks; after
the second, which was made by night, they found
a dead dog at Ghost Tickle.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Tog entered Ghost Tickle by daylight,
and with his teeth made good his right to
come and go at will. It was this that left him
open to suspicion when the Ghost Tickle tragedy
occurred. Whether or not Tog was concerned
in that affair, nobody knows. They say at Ghost
Tickle that he plotted the murder and led the
pack; but the opinion is based merely upon the
fact that he was familiar with the paths and lurking
places of the Tickle&ndash;&ndash;and, possibly, upon the
fact of his immediate and significant disappearance
from the haunts of men.</p>
<p>News came from Ghost Tickle that Jonathan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
Wall had come late from the ice with a seal.
Weary with the long tramp, he had left the
carcass at the waterside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; he said to his young son, forgetting
the darkness and the dogs, &#8220;go fetch that swile
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy was gone a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s keepin&#8217; Billy,&#8221; his mother
said.</p>
<p>They grew uneasy, at last; and presently they
set out to search for the lad. Neither child nor
seal did they ever see again; but they came
upon the shocking evidences of what had occurred.</p>
<p>And they blamed Tog of Buccaneer Cove.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>For a month or more Tog was lost to sight;
but an epidemic had so reduced the number
of serviceable dogs that he was often in Jim
Grimm&#8217;s mind. Jim very heartily declared that
Tog should have a berth with the team if starvation
drove him back; not that he loved Tog,
said he, but that he needed him. But Tog
seemed to be doing well enough in the wilderness.
He did not soon return. Once they saw
him. It was when Jim and Jimmie were bound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
home from Laughing Cove. Of a sudden Jim
halted the team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you see that, Jimmie, b&#8217;y?&#8221; he asked,
pointing with his whip to the white crest of a
near-by hill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dogs!&#8221; Jimmie ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take another squint,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dogs,&#8221; Jimmie repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wolves,&#8221; drawled Jim. &#8220;An&#8217; do you see
the beast with the black eye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, dad,&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed, &#8220;&#8217;tis Tog!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;that Tog don&#8217;t need us
no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tog did. He came back&ndash;&ndash;lean and fawning.
No more abject contrition was ever shown
by dog before. He was starving. They fed
him at the usual hour; and not one ounce more
than the usual amount of food did he get. Next
day he took his old place in the traces and
helped haul Jim Grimm the round of the fox
traps. But that night Jim Grimm lost another
dog; and in the morning Tog had again disappeared
into the wilderness. Jimmie Grimm was
glad. Tog had grown beyond him. The lad
could control the others of the pack; but he was
helpless against Tog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t so wonderful sorry, myself,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;I &#8217;low, Jimmie,&#8221; he added, &#8220;that Tog don&#8217;t like
<i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that he doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; Jimmie promptly agreed.
&#8220;All day yesterday he snooped around, with an
eye on me. Looked to me as if he was waitin&#8217;
for me to fall down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie!&#8221; said Jim Grimm, gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>mustn&#8217;t</i> fall down. Don&#8217;t matter whether
Tog&#8217;s about or not. If the dogs is near, <i>don&#8217;t
you fall down!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I knows it,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was a clear night in March. The moon was
high. From the rear of Jim Grimm&#8217;s isolated
cottage the white waste stretched far to the
wilderness. The dogs of the pack were sound
asleep in the outhouse. An hour ago the
mournful howling had ceased for the night.
Half-way to the fish-stage, whither he was
bound on his father&#8217;s errand, Jimmie Grimm
came to a startled full stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221; he mused.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_3' id='linki_3'></a>

INSTINCTIVELY, HE COVERED HIS THROAT WITH HIS ARMS WHEN TOG FELL UPON HIM.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>A dark object, long and lithe, had seemed to
slip like a shadow into hiding below the drying
flake. Jimmie continued to muse. What had
it been? A prowling dog? Then he laughed
a little at his own fears&ndash;&ndash;and continued on his
way. But he kept watch on the flake; and so
intent was he upon this, so busily was he
wondering whether or not his eyes had tricked
him, that he stumbled over a stray billet of
wood, and fell sprawling.</p>
<p>He was not alarmed, and made no haste to
rise; but had he then seen what emerged from
the shadow of the flake he would instantly
have been in screaming flight toward the kitchen
door.</p>
<p>The onslaught of Tog and the two wolves was
made silently.</p>
<p>There was not a howl, not a growl, not even
an eager snarl. They came leaping, with Tog in
the lead&ndash;&ndash;and they came silently. Jimmie
caught sight of them when he was half-way to
his feet. He had but time to call his father&#8217;s
name; and he knew that the cry would not be
heard. Instinctively, he covered his throat with
his arms when Tog fell upon him; and he was
relieved to feel Tog&#8217;s teeth in his shoulder. He
felt no pain&ndash;&ndash;not any more, at any rate, than a
sharp stab in the knee. He was merely sensible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
of the fact that the vital part had not yet been
reached.</p>
<p>In the savage joy of attack, Jimmie&#8217;s assailants
forgot discretion. Snarls and growls escaped
them while they worried the small body. In
the manner of wolves, too, they snapped at each
other. The dogs in the outhouse awoke, cocked
their ears, came in a frenzy to the conflict; not
to save Jimmie Grimm, but to participate in his
destruction. Jimmie was prostrate beneath them
all&ndash;&ndash;still protecting his throat; not regarding his
other parts.</p>
<p>And by this confusion Jim Grimm was aroused
from a sleepy stupor by the kitchen fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said he, &#8220;what&#8217;s the matter with
them dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not able t&#8217; make out,&#8221; his wife replied,
puzzled, &#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; cried Jim.</p>
<p>They listened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; Jimmie&#8217;s mother screamed.
&#8220;They&#8217;re at Jimmie!&#8221;</p>
<p>With an axe in his hand, and with merciless
wrath in his heart, Jim Grimm descended upon
the dogs. He stretched the uppermost dead.
A second blow broke the back of a wolf. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
third sent a dog yelping to the outhouse with a
useless hind leg. The remaining dogs decamped.
Their howls expressed pain in a degree to delight
Jim Grimm and to inspire him with deadly
strength and purpose. Tog and the surviving
wolf fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmie!&#8221; Jim Grimm called.</p>
<p>Jimmie did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve killed you!&#8221; his father sobbed.
&#8220;Jimmie, b&#8217;y, is you dead? Mother,&#8221; he
moaned to his wife, who had now come panting
up with a broomstick, &#8220;they&#8217;ve gone an&#8217; killed
our Jimmie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie was unconscious when his father
carried him into the house. It was late in the
night, and he was lying in his own little bed,
and his mother had dressed his wounds, when
he revived. And Tog was then howling under
his window; and there Tog remained until
dawn, listening to the child&#8217;s cries of agony.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Two days later, Jim Grimm, practicing unscrupulous
deception, lured Tog into captivity.
That afternoon the folk of Buccaneer Cove
solemnly hanged him by the neck until he was
dead, which is the custom in that land. I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
glad that they disposed of him. He had a noble
body&ndash;&ndash;strong and beautiful, giving delight to
the beholder, capable of splendid usefulness.
But he had not one redeeming trait of character
to justify his existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why Tog was so bad, dad,&#8221; Jimmie
mused, one day, when, as they mistakenly
thought, he was near well again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I s&#8217;pose,&#8221; Jim explained, &#8220;&#8217;twas because his
father was a wolf.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Jimmie Grimm was not the same after
that. For some strange reason he went lame, and
the folk of Buccaneer Cove said that he was &#8220;took
with the rheumatiz.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I could be cured,&#8221; the little fellow used
to sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Little Jimmie Grimm Goes Lame and His Mother
Discovers the Whereabouts of a Cure</i></p>
<p>Little Jimmie Grimm was then ten years
old. He had been an active, merry lad,
before the night of the assault of Tog
and the two wolves&ndash;&ndash;inclined to scamper and
shout, given to pranks of a kindly sort. His
affectionate, light-hearted disposition had made
him the light of his mother&#8217;s eyes, and of his
father&#8217;s, too, for, child though he was, lonely
Jim Grimm found him a comforting companion.
But he was now taken with what the
folk of Buccaneer Cove called &#8220;rheumatiz o&#8217;
the knee.&#8221; There were days when he walked in
comfort; but there were also times when he fell
to the ground in a sudden agony and had to be
carried home. There were weeks when he could
not walk at all. He was not now so merry as
he had been. He was more affectionate; but
his eyes did not flash in the old way, nor were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
his cheeks so fat and rosy. Jim Grimm and the
lad&#8217;s mother greatly desired to have him cured.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be like old times,&#8221; Jim Grimm said
once, when Jimmie was put to bed, &#8220;if Jimmie
was only well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afeared,&#8221; the mother sighed, &#8220;that he&#8217;ll
never be well again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For fear you&#8217;re right, mum,&#8221; said Jim
Grimm, &#8220;we must make him happy every hour
he&#8217;s with us. Hush, mother! Don&#8217;t cry, or I&#8217;ll
be cryin&#8217;, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody connected Jimmie Grimm&#8217;s affliction
with the savage teeth of Tog.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was Jimmie&#8217;s mother who discovered the
whereabouts of a cure. Hook&#8217;s Kurepain was
the thing to do it! Who could deny the
virtues of that &#8220;healing balm&#8221;? They were set
forth in print, in type both large and small, on
a creased and dirty remnant of the <i>Montreal
Weekly Globe and Family Messenger</i>, which
had providentially strayed into that far port of
the Labrador. Who could dispute the works of
&#8220;the invaluable discovery&#8221;? Was it not a
positive cure for bruises, sprains, chilblains,
cracked hands, stiffness of the joints, contraction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
of the muscles, numbness of the limbs, neuralgia,
rheumatism, pains in the chest, warts, frost bites,
sore throat, quinsy, croup, and various other
ills? Was it not an excellent hair restorer, as
well? If it had cured millions (and apparently
it had), why shouldn&#8217;t it cure little Jimmie
Grimm? So Jimmie&#8217;s mother longed with her
whole heart for a bottle of the &#8220;boon to suffering
humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found something, Jim Grimm,&#8221; said she,
a teasing twinkle in her eye, when, that night,
Jimmie&#8217;s father came in from the snowy wilderness,
where he had made the round of his fox traps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you, now?&#8221; he asked, curiously.
&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis something,&#8221; said she, &#8220;t&#8217; make you
glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, tell me!&#8221; he cried, his eyes shining.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you say,&#8221; she went on, smiling
softly, &#8220;that you&#8217;d be willin&#8217; t&#8217; give anything t&#8217;
find it. I&#8217;ve heard you say that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a silver fox!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard you say,&#8221; she continued, shaking
her head, &#8220;&#8216;Oh,&#8217; I&#8217;ve heard you say, &#8216;if I could
<i>only</i> find it I&#8217;d be happy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me!&#8221; he coaxed. &#8220;Please tell me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>She laid a hand on his shoulder. The remnant
of the <i>Montreal Weekly Globe and Family Messenger</i>
she held behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a cure for Jimmie,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he cried, incredulous; but there was
yet the ring of hope in his voice. &#8220;Have you,
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hook&#8217;s Kurepain,&#8221; said she, &#8220;never failed
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis wonderful!&#8221; said Jim Grimm.</p>
<p>She spread the newspaper on the table and
placed her finger at that point of the list where
the cure of rheumatism was promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read that,&#8221; said she, &#8220;an&#8217; you&#8217;ll find &#8217;tis all
true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Grimm&#8217;s eye ran up to the top of the page.
His wife waited, a smile on her lips. She was
anticipating a profound impression.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Beauty has wonderful charms,&#8217;&#8221; Jim Grimm
read. &#8220;&#8216;Few men can withstand the witchcraft
of a lovely face. All hearts are won&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; the mother interrupted, hastily.
&#8220;That&#8217;s the marvellous Oriental Beautifier. I
been readin&#8217; that, too. But &#8217;tis not that. &#8217;Tis
lower down. Beginnin&#8217;, &#8216;At last the universal
remedy of Biblical times.&#8217; Is you got it yet?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>And thereupon Jim Grimm of Buccaneer Cove
discovered that a legion of relieved and rejuvenated
rheumatics had without remuneration
or constraint sung the virtues of the Kurepain
and the praises of Hook. Poor ignorant Jim
Grimm did not for a moment doubt the
existence of the Well-Known Traveller, the
Family Doctor, the Minister of the Gospel, the
Champion of the World. He was ready to admit
that the cure had been found.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willin&#8217; t&#8217; believe,&#8221; said he, solemnly, the
while gazing very earnestly into his wife&#8217;s eyes,
&#8220;that &#8217;twould do Jimmie a world o&#8217; good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read on,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It costs money to make the Kurepain,&#8217;&#8221;
Jim read, aloud. &#8220;&#8216;It is not a sugar-and-water
remedy. It is a <i>cure</i>, manufactured at <i>great expense</i>.
Good medicines come <i>high</i>. But the
peerless Kurepain is <i>cheap</i> when compared with
the worthless substitutes now on the market and
sold for just as good. Our price is five dollars a
bottle; three bottles guaranteed to cure.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Grimm stopped dead. He looked up.
His wife steadily returned his glance. The Labrador
dweller is a poor man&ndash;&ndash;a very poor man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
Rarely does a dollar of hard cash slip into his
hand. And this was hard cash. Five dollars a
bottle! Five dollars for that which was neither
food nor clothing!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis fearful!&#8221; he sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But read on,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;In order to introduce the Kurepain into this
locality, we have set aside <i>one thousand bottles</i>
of this <i>incomparable</i> medicine. That number,
<i>and no more</i>, we will dispose of at four dollars a
bottle. Do not make a mistake. When the
supply is exhausted, the price will <i>rise</i> to eight
dollars a bottle, owing to a scarcity of one of the
ingredients. We honestly advise you, if you are
in pain or suffering, to take advantage of this
<i>rare</i> opportunity. A word to the wise is sufficient.
Order to-day.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a great bargain, Jim,&#8221; the mother whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; Jim answered, dubiously.</p>
<p>His wife patted his hand. &#8220;When Jimmie&#8217;s
cured,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;he could help you with
the traps, an&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not for <i>that</i> I wants un cured,&#8221; Jim
Grimm flashed. &#8220;I&#8217;m willin&#8217; an&#8217; able for me
labour. &#8217;Tis not for that. I&#8217;m just thinkin&#8217; all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the time about seein&#8217; him run about like he used
to. That&#8217;s what <i>I</i> wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t you think, Jim, that we could manage
it&ndash;&ndash;if we tried wonderful hard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis accordin&#8217; t&#8217; what fur I traps, mum, afore
the ice goes an&#8217; the steamer comes. I&#8217;m hopin&#8217;
we&#8217;ll have enough left over t&#8217; buy the cure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good father, Jim,&#8221; the mother said,
at last. &#8220;I knows you&#8217;ll do for the best. Leave
us wait until the spring time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; he agreed; &#8220;an&#8217; we&#8217;ll say nar a word
t&#8217; little Jimmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>They laid hold on the hope in Hook&#8217;s Kurepain.
Life was brighter, then. They looked
forward to the cure. The old merry, scampering
Jimmie, with his shouts and laughter and
gambols and pranks, was to return to them.
When, as the winter dragged along, Jim Grimm
brought home the fox skins from the wilderness,
Jimmie fondled them, and passed upon their
quality, as to colour and size and fur. Jim
Grimm and his wife exchanged smiles. Jimmie
did not know that upon the quality and number
of the skins, which he delighted to stroke and
pat, depended his cure. Let the winter pass!
Let the ice move out from the coast! Let the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
steamer come for the letters! Let her go and
return again! <i>Then</i> Jimmie should know.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be able t&#8217; have <i>one</i> bottle, whatever,&#8221;
said the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be more than that, mum,&#8221; Jim Grimm
answered, confidently. &#8220;We wants our Jimmie
cured.&#8221;</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Jimmie Grimm Surprises a Secret, Jim Grimm makes a
Rash Promise, and a Tourist From the States Discovers the Marks
of Tog&#8217;s Teeth</i></p>
<p>With spring came the great disappointment.
The snow melted from the
hills; wild flowers blossomed where
the white carpet had lain; the ice was ready to
break and move out to sea with the next wind
from the west. There were no more foxes to be
caught. Jim Grimm bundled the skins, strapped
them on his back, and took them to the storekeeper
at Shelter Harbour, five miles up the
coast; and when their value had been determined
he came home disconsolate.</p>
<p>Jimmie&#8217;s mother had been watching from the
window. &#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, when the man
came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not enough,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,
mum; but &#8217;tis not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said nothing, but waited for him to continue;
for she feared to give him greater distress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas a fair price he gave me,&#8221; Jim Grimm
continued. &#8220;I&#8217;m not complainin&#8217; o&#8217; that. But
there&#8217;s not enough t&#8217; do more than keep us in
food, with pinchin&#8217;, till we sells the fish in the
fall. I&#8217;m sick, mum&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m fair sick an&#8217; miserable
along o&#8217; disappointment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis sad t&#8217; think,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;that
Jimmie&#8217;s not t&#8217; be cured&ndash;&ndash;after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the want o&#8217; twelve dollars!&#8221; he sighed.</p>
<p>They were interrupted by the clatter of Jimmie&#8217;s
crutches, coming in haste from the inner
room. Then entered Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heered what you said,&#8221; he cried, his eyes
blazing, his whole worn little body fairly quivering
with excitement. &#8220;I heered you say &#8217;cure.&#8217;
Is I t&#8217; be cured?&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Mama! Did you say I was t&#8217; be
cured?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, dear!&#8221; said the mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hush. I wants t&#8217; know. Father, tell
me. Is I t&#8217; be cured?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; said the mother to Jim Grimm, &#8220;tell
un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You is!&#8221; Jim shouted, catching Jimmie in
his arms, and rocking him like a baby. &#8220;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
<i>is</i> t&#8217; be cured. Debt or no debt, lad, I&#8217;ll see you
cured!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The matter of credit was easily managed.
The old storekeeper at Shelter Harbour did not
hesitate. Credit? Of course, he would give
Jim Grimm that. &#8220;Jim,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ve knowed
you for a long time, an&#8217; I knows you t&#8217; be a
good man. I&#8217;ll fit you out for the summer an&#8217;
the winter, if you wants me to, an&#8217; you can take
your own time about payin&#8217; the bill.&#8221; And so
Jim Grimm withdrew twelve dollars from the
credit of his account.</p>
<p>They began to keep watch on the ice&ndash;&ndash;to wish
for a westerly gale, that the white waste might be
broken and dispersed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Jimmie, one night, when the
man was putting him to bed, &#8220;how long will it
be afore that there Kurepain comes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low the steamer&#8217;ll soon be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; then she&#8217;ll take the letter with the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; she&#8217;ll be gone about a month an&#8217; a fortnight,
an&#8217; then she&#8217;ll be back with&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cure!&#8221; cried Jimmie, giving his father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
an affectionate dig in the ribs. &#8220;She&#8217;ll be back
with the cure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go t&#8217; sleep, lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; Jimmie whispered. &#8220;I can&#8217;t for
joy o&#8217; thinkin&#8217; o&#8217; that cure.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>By and by the ice moved out, and, in good
time, the steamer came. It was at the end of a
blustering day, with the night falling thick.
Passengers and crew alike&ndash;&ndash;from the grimy
stokers to the shivering American tourists&ndash;&ndash;were
relieved to learn, when the anchor went down
with a splash and a rumble, that the &#8220;old man&#8221;
was to &#8220;hang her down&#8221; until the weather
turned &#8220;civil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accompanied by the old schoolmaster, who
was to lend him aid in registering the letter to
the Kurepain Company, Jim Grimm went aboard
in the punt. It was then dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knows a Yankee when you sees one,&#8221;
said he, when they reached the upper deck.
&#8220;Point un out, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll ask un.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, <i>I&#8217;m</i> travelled,&#8221; said the schoolmaster,
importantly. &#8220;And &#8217;twould be wise to ask
about this Kurepain Company before you post
the letter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>Thus it came about that Jim Grimm timidly
approached two gentlemen who were chatting
merrily in the lee of the wheel-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know the Kurepain, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? What?&#8221; the one replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hook&#8217;s, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hook&#8217;s? In the name of wonder, man,
Hook&#8217;s what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurepain, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hook&#8217;s Kurepain,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;Doctor,&#8221;
addressing his companion, &#8220;do you recommend&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you do not?&#8221; said the other.</p>
<p>The doctor eyed Jim Grimm. &#8220;Why do you
ask?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis for me little son, sir,&#8221; Jim replied.
&#8220;He&#8217;ve a queer sort o&#8217; rheumaticks. We&#8217;re
thinkin&#8217; the Kurepain will cure un. It have
cured a Minister o&#8217; the Gospel, sir, an&#8217; a Champion
o&#8217; the World; an&#8217; we was allowin&#8217; that it
wouldn&#8217;t have much trouble t&#8217; cure little Jimmie
Grimm. They&#8217;s as much as twelve dollars, sir,
in this here letter, which I&#8217;m sendin&#8217; away. I&#8217;m
wantin&#8217; t&#8217; know, sir, if they&#8217;ll send the cure if I
sends the money.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>The doctor was silent for a moment. &#8220;Where
do you live?&#8221; he asked, at last.</p>
<p>Jim pointed to a far-off light. &#8220;Jimmie will
be at that window,&#8221; he said, &#8220;lookin&#8217; out at the
steamer&#8217;s lights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you care for a run ashore?&#8221; asked the
doctor, turning to his fellow tourist.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it would not overtax you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m strong enough, now. The voyage
has put me on my feet again. Come&ndash;&ndash;let
us go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Grimm took them ashore in the punt;
guided them along the winding, rocky path; led
them into the room where Jimmie sat at the window.
The doctor felt of Jimmie&#8217;s knee, and
asked him many questions. Then he held a
whispered consultation with his companion and
the schoolmaster; and of their conversation
Jimmie caught such words and phrases as
&#8220;slight operation&#8221; and &#8220;chloroform&#8221; and &#8220;that
table&#8221; and &#8220;poor light, but light enough&#8221; and
&#8220;rough and ready sort of work&#8221; and &#8220;no
danger.&#8221; Then Jim Grimm was dispatched to
the steamer with the doctor&#8217;s friend; and when
they came back the man carried a bag in his
hand. The doctor asked Jimmie a question, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Jimmie nodded his head. Whereupon, the doctor
called him a brave lad, and sent Jim Grimm
out to the kitchen to keep his wife company for
a time, first requiring him to bring a pail of
water and another lamp.</p>
<p>When they called Jim Grimm in again&ndash;&ndash;he
knew what they were about, and it seemed a
long, long time before the call came&ndash;&ndash;little
Jimmie was lying on the couch, sick and pale,
with his knee tightly bandaged, but with his eyes
glowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mama! Father!&#8221; the boy whispered, exultantly.
&#8220;They says I&#8217;m cured.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the doctor; &#8220;he&#8217;ll be all right,
now. His trouble was not rheumatism. It was
caused by a fragment of the bone, broken off at
the knee-joint. At least, that&#8217;s as plain as I can
make it to you. He was bitten by a dog, was
he not? So he says. And he remembers that
he felt a stab of pain in his knee at the time.
That or the fall probably accounts for it. At
any rate, I have removed that fragment. He&#8217;ll
be all right, after a bit. I&#8217;ve told the schoolmaster
how to take care of him, and I&#8217;ll leave
some medicine, and&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;ll soon be all
right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>When the doctor was about to step from the
punt to the steamer&#8217;s ladder, half an hour later,
Jim Grimm held up a letter to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis for you, sir,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; the doctor demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis for you to keep, sir,&#8221; Jim answered,
with dignity. &#8220;&#8217;Tis the money for the work
you done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money!&#8221; cried the doctor. &#8220;Why, really,&#8221;
he stammered, &#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;you see, this is my vacation&ndash;&ndash;and
I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low, sir,&#8221; said Jim, quietly, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll
&#8217;blige me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; exclaimed the doctor, being
wise, &#8220;that I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm got well long before it occurred
to his father that the fishing at Buccaneer Cove
was poor and that he might do better elsewhere.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Jimmie Grimm Moves to Ruddy Cove and Settles on the
Slope of the Broken Nose, Where, Falling in With Billy Topsail
and Donald North, He Finds the Latter a Coward, But Learns the
Reason, and Scoffs no Longer. In Which, Also, Donald North Leaps
a Breaker to Save a Salmon Net, and Acquires a Strut</i></p>
<p>When old Jim Grimm moved to Ruddy
Cove and settled his wife and son in
a little white cottage on the slope of a
bare hill called Broken Nose, Jimmie Grimm was
not at all sorry. There were other boys at
Ruddy Cove&ndash;&ndash;far more boys, and jollier boys,
and boys with more time to spare, than at Buccaneer.
There was Billy Topsail, for one, a tow-headed,
blue-eyed, active lad of Jimmie&#8217;s age;
and there was Donald North, for another. Jimmie
Grimm liked them both. Billy Topsail was
the elder, and up to more agreeable tricks; but
Donald was good enough company for anybody,
and would have been quite as admirable as Billy
Topsail had it not been that he was afraid of the
sea. They did not call him a coward at Ruddy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Cove; they merely said that he was afraid of the
sea.</p>
<p>And Donald North was.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Jimmie Grimm, himself no coward in a blow
of wind, was inclined to scoff, at first; but Billy
Topsail explained, and then Jimmie Grimm
scoffed no longer, but hoped that Donald North
would be cured of fear before he was much
older. As Billy Topsail made plain to the boy,
in excuse of his friend, Donald North was brave
enough until he was eight years old; but after
the accident of that season he was so timid that
he shrank from the edge of the cliff when the
breakers were beating the rocks below, and
trembled when his father&#8217;s fishing punt heeled to
the faintest gust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; he had said to Billy Topsail, on the
unfortunate day when he caught the fear, being
then but a little chap, &#8220;leave us go sail my new
fore-an&#8217;-after. I&#8217;ve rigged her out with a fine
new mizzens&#8217;l.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, b&#8217;y!&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle George&#8217;s wharf-head. &#8217;Tis a place as
good as any.&#8221;</p>
<p>Off Uncle George&#8217;s wharf-head the water was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
deep&ndash;&ndash;deeper than Donald could fathom at low
tide&ndash;&ndash;and it was cold, and covered a rocky
bottom, upon which a multitude of starfish and
prickly sea-eggs lay in clusters. It was green,
smooth and clear, too; sight carried straight
down to where the purple-shelled mussels
gripped the rocks.</p>
<p>The tide had fallen somewhat and was still on
the ebb. Donald found it a long reach from the
wharf to the water. By and by, as the water ran
out of the harbour, the most he could do was to
touch the tip of the mast of the miniature ship
with his fingers. Then a little gust of wind crept
round the corner of the wharf, rippling the water
as it came near. It caught the sails of the new
fore-and-after, and the little craft fell over on another
tack and shot away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, you!&#8221; Donald cried. &#8220;Come back,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached for the mast. His fingers touched
it, but the boat escaped before they closed. He
laughed, hitched nearer to the edge of the wharf,
and reached again. The wind had failed; the
little boat was tossing in the ripples, below and
just beyond his grasp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t cotch her!&#8221; he called to Billy Topsail,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
who was back near the net-horse, looking
for squids.</p>
<p>Billy looked up, and laughed to see Donald&#8217;s
awkward position&ndash;&ndash;to see him hanging over
the water, red-faced and straining. Donald
laughed, too. At once he lost his balance and
fell forward.</p>
<p>This was in the days before he could swim, so
he floundered about in the water, beating it
wildly, to bring himself to the surface. When
he came up, Billy Topsail was leaning over to
catch him. Donald lifted his arm. His fingers
touched Billy&#8217;s, that was all&ndash;&ndash;just touched them.</p>
<p>Then he sank; and when he came up again,
and again lifted his arm, there was half a foot
of space between his hand and Billy&#8217;s. Some
measure of self-possession returned. He took a
long breath, and let himself sink. Down he
went, weighted by his heavy boots.</p>
<p>Those moments were full of the terror of
which, later, he could not rid himself. There
seemed to be no end to the depth of the water in
that place. But when his feet touched bottom,
he was still deliberate in all that he did.</p>
<p>For a moment he let them rest on the rock.
Then he gave himself a strong upward push.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
It needed but little to bring him within reach of
Billy Topsail&#8217;s hand. He shot out of the water
and caught that hand. Soon afterwards he was
safe on the wharf.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, mum, I thought I were drownded that
time!&#8221; he said to his mother, that night.
&#8220;When I were goin&#8217; down the last time I
thought I&#8217;d never see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you wasn&#8217;t drownded, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said his
mother, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I might ha&#8217; been,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>There was the rub. He was haunted by what
might have happened. Soon he became a timid,
shrinking lad, utterly lacking confidence in the
strength of his arms and his skill with an oar
and a sail; and after that came to pass, his life
was hard. He was afraid to go out to the fishing-grounds,
where he must go every day with
his father to keep the head of the punt up to the
wind, and he had a great fear of the wind and
the fog and the breakers. But he was not a
coward. On the contrary, although he was
circumspect in all his dealings with the sea, he
never failed in his duty.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>In Ruddy Cove all the men put out their
salmon nets when the ice breaks up and drifts
away southward, for the spring run of salmon
then begins. These nets are laid in the sea, at
right angles to the rocks and extending out from
them; they are set alongshore, it may be a mile
or two, from the narrow passage to the harbour.
The outer end is buoyed and anchored, and the
other is lashed to an iron stake which is driven
deep into some crevice of the rock.</p>
<p>When belated icebergs hang offshore a watch
must be kept on the nets, lest they be torn away
or ground to pulp by the ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind&#8217;s haulin&#8217; round a bit, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said
Donald&#8217;s father, one day in spring, when the lad
was twelve years old, and he was in the company
of Jimmie Grimm and Billy Topsail on the sunny
slope of the Broken Nose. &#8220;I think &#8217;twill freshen
and blow inshore afore night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s a scattered pan of ice out there,
father,&#8221; said Donald, &#8220;and three small
bergs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, b&#8217;y, I knows,&#8221; said North. &#8220;&#8217;Tis that
I&#8217;m afeared of. If the wind changes a bit more,
&#8217;twill jam the ice agin the rocks. Does you think
the net is safe?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm glanced at Billy Topsail; and
Billy Topsail glanced at Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-wh-what, sir?&#8221; Donald stammered.</p>
<p>It was quite evident that the net was in danger,
but since Donald had first shown sign of fearing
the sea, Job North had not compelled him to go
out upon perilous undertakings. He had fallen
into the habit of leaving the boy to choose his
own course, believing that in time he would
master himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I says,&#8221; he repeated, quietly, &#8220;does you
think that net&#8217;s in danger?&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy Topsail nudged Jimmie Grimm. They
walked off together. It would never do to witness
a display of Donald&#8217;s cowardice.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not go,&#8221; Jimmie Grimm declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not so sure,&#8221; said Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; Jimmie repeated, confidently,
&#8220;that he&#8217;ll never go out t&#8217; save that net.&#8221;
&#8220;But!&#8221; he added; &#8220;he&#8217;ll have no heart for the
leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;ll go,&#8221; Billy insisted.</p>
<p>In the meantime Job North had stood regarding
his son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, son,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;what you think
about that net?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think, sir,&#8221; said Donald, steadily, between
his teeth, &#8220;that the net should come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Job North patted the boy on the back.
&#8220;&#8217;Twould be wise, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said he, smiling.
&#8220;Come, b&#8217;y; we&#8217;ll go fetch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long, Don!&#8221; Billy Topsail shouted delightedly.</p>
<p>Donald and his father put out in the punt.
There was a fair, fresh wind, and with this filling
the little brown sail, they were soon driven out
from the quiet water of the harbour to the heaving
sea itself. Great swells rolled in from the
open and broke furiously against the coast rocks.
The punt ran alongshore for two miles, keeping
well away from the breakers. When at last she
came to that point where Job North&#8217;s net was
set, Donald furled the sail and his father took up
the oars.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be a bit hard to land,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Therein lay the danger. There is no beach
along that coast. The rocks rise abruptly from
the sea&ndash;&ndash;here, sheer and towering; there, low
and broken. When there is a sea running, the
swells roll in and break against these rocks; and
when the breakers catch a punt, they are certain
to smash it to splinters.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>The iron stake to which Job North&#8217;s net was
lashed was fixed in a low ledge, upon which
some hardy shrubs had taken root. The waves
were casting themselves against the rocks below,
breaking with a great roar and flinging spray
over the ledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be a bit hard,&#8221; North said again.</p>
<p>But the salmon-fishers have a way of landing
under such conditions. When their nets are in
danger they do not hesitate. The man at the
oars lets the boat drift with the breaker stern
foremost towards the rocks. His mate leaps
from the stern seat to the ledge. Then the other
pulls the boat out of danger before the wave curls
and breaks. It is the only way.</p>
<p>But sometimes the man in the stern miscalculates&ndash;&ndash;leaps
too soon, stumbles, leaps short. He
falls back, and is almost inevitably drowned.
Sometimes, too, the current of the wave is too
strong for the man at the oars; his punt is
swept in, pull as hard as he may, and he is overwhelmed
with her. Donald knew all this. He
had lived in dread of the time when he must first
make that leap.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ice is comin&#8217; in, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said North.
&#8220;&#8217;Twill scrape these here rocks, certain sure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
Does you think you&#8217;re strong enough to take
the oars an&#8217; let me go ashore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never leaped afore, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you try it now, b&#8217;y?&#8221; said North,
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Donald said, faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get ready, then,&#8221; said North.</p>
<p>With a stroke or two of the oars Job swung
the stern of the boat to the rocks. He kept her
hanging in this position until the water fell back
and gathered in a new wave; then he lifted his
oars. Donald was crouched on the stern seat,
waiting for the moment to rise and spring.</p>
<p>The boat moved in, running on the crest of the
wave which would a moment later break against
the rock. Donald stood up, and fixed his eye on
the ledge. He was afraid; all the strength and
courage he possessed seemed to desert him. The
punt was now almost on a level with the ledge.
The wave was about to curl and fall. It was the
precise moment when he must leap&ndash;&ndash;that instant,
too, when the punt must be pulled out of the grip
of the breaker, if at all.</p>
<p>Billy Topsail and Jimmie Grimm were at this
critical moment hanging off Grief Island, in the
lee, whence they could see all that occurred.
They had come out to watch the issue of Donald&#8217;s
courage.</p>

</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never leap,&#8221; Jimmie exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will,&#8221; said Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not,&#8221; Jimmie declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; cried Billy.</p>
<p>Donald felt of a sudden that he <i>must</i> do this
thing. Therefore why not do it courageously?
He leaped; but this new courage had not come
in time. He made the ledge, but he fell an inch
short of a firm footing. So for a moment he
tottered, between falling forward and falling back.
Then he caught the branch of an overhanging
shrub, and with this saved himself. When he
turned, Job had the punt in safety; but he was
breathing hard, as if the strain had been great.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas not so hard, was it, b&#8217;y?&#8221; said Job.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; said Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you so,&#8221; said Billy Topsail to Jimmie
Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good b&#8217;y!&#8221; Jimmie declared, as he hoisted
the sail for the homeward run.</p>
<p>Donald cast the net line loose from its mooring,
and saw that it was all clear. His father let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the punt sweep in again. It is much easier to
leap from a solid rock than from a boat, so
Donald jumped in without difficulty. Then
they rowed out to the buoy and hauled the great,
dripping net over the side.</p>
<p>It was well they had gone out, for before
morning the ice had drifted over the place where
the net had been. More than that, Donald North
profited by his experience. He perceived that if
perils must be encountered, they are best met
with a clear head and an unflinching heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht you&#8217;d been out t&#8217; see me jump the
day,&#8221; he said to Jimmie Grimm, that night.</p>
<p>Billy and Jimmie laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht you had,&#8221; Donald repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We was,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>Donald threw back his head, puffed out his
chest, dug his hands in his pockets and strutted
off. It was the first time, poor lad! he had ever
won the right to swagger in the presence of
Jimmie Grimm and Billy Topsail. To be sure,
he made the most of it!</p>
<p>But he was not yet cured.</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which, Much to the Delight of Jimmie Grimm and Billy
Topsail, Donald North, Having Perilous Business On a Pan of Ice
After Night, is Cured of Fear, and Once More Puffs Out His Chest
and Struts Like a Rooster</i></p>
<p>Like many another snug little harbour on
the northeast coast of Newfoundland,
Ruddy Cove is confronted by the sea
and flanked by a vast wilderness; so all the folk
take their living from the sea, as their forebears
have done for generations. In the gales and
high seas of the summer following, and in the
blinding snow-storms and bitter cold of the
winter, Donald North grew in fine readiness to
face peril at the call of duty. All that he had
gained was put to the test in the next spring,
when the floating ice, which drifts out of the
north in the spring break-up, was driven by the
wind against the coast.</p>
<p>After that adventure, Jimmie Grimm said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Don!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Billy Topsail said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Don!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></p>
<p>Donald North, himself, stuck his hands in his
pockets, threw out his chest, spat like a skipper
and strutted like a rooster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low I <i>is</i>!&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>And he was. And nobody decried his little
way of boasting, which lasted only for a day;
and everybody was glad that at last he was like
other boys.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Job North, with Alexander Bludd and Bill
Stevens, went out on the ice to hunt seal. The
hunt led them ten miles offshore. In the afternoon
of that day the wind gave some sign of
changing to the west, and at dusk it was blowing
half a gale offshore. When the wind blows
offshore it sweeps all this wandering ice out to
sea, and disperses the whole pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go see if your father&#8217;s comin&#8217;, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said
Donald&#8217;s mother. &#8220;I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; terrible nervous
about the ice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald took his gaff&ndash;&ndash;a long pole of the
light, tough dogwood, two inches thick and
shod with iron&ndash;&ndash;and set out. It was growing
dark. The wind, rising still, was blowing in
strong, cold gusts. It began to snow while he
was yet on the ice of the harbour, half a mile away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
from the pans and dumpers which the wind of
the day before had crowded against the coast.</p>
<p>When he came to the &#8220;standing edge&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;the
stationary rim of ice which is frozen to the coast&ndash;&ndash;the
wind was thickly charged with snow.
What with dusk and snow, he found it hard to
keep to the right way. But he was not afraid
for himself; his only fear was that the wind
would sweep the ice-pack out to sea before his
father reached the standing edge. In that
event, as he knew, Job North would be doomed.</p>
<p>Donald went out on the standing edge.
Beyond lay a widening gap of water. The pack
had already begun to move out.</p>
<p>There was no sign of Job North&#8217;s party. The
lad ran up and down, hallooing as he ran; but
for a time there was no answer to his call. Then
it seemed to him that he heard a despairing hail,
sounding far to the right, whence he had come.
Night had almost fallen, and the snow added to
its depth; but as he ran back Donald could still
see across the gap of water to the great pan of
ice, which, of all the pack, was nearest to the standing
edge. He perceived that the gap had considerably
widened since he had first observed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, father?&#8221; he called.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, Donald,&#8221; came an answering hail from
directly opposite. &#8220;Is there a small pan of ice
on your side?&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald searched up and down the standing
edge for a detached cake large enough for his
purpose. Near at hand he came upon a small,
thin pan, not more than six feet square.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haste, b&#8217;y!&#8221; cried his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s one here,&#8221; he called back, &#8220;but &#8217;tis
too small. Is there none there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, b&#8217;y. Fetch that over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was desperate need. If the lad were to
meet it, he must act instantly and fearlessly. He
stepped out on the pan and pushed off with his
gaff. Using his gaff as a paddle&ndash;&ndash;as these gaffs
are constantly used in ferrying by the Newfoundland
fishermen&ndash;&ndash;and helped by the wind, he soon
ferried himself to where Job North stood waiting
with his companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis too small,&#8221; said Stevens. &#8220;&#8217;Twill not
hold two.&#8221;</p>
<p>North looked dubiously at the pan. Alexander
Bludd shook his head in despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get back while you can, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said North.
&#8220;Quick! We&#8217;re driftin&#8217; fast! The pan&#8217;s too
small.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thinks &#8217;tis big enough for one man an&#8217; me,&#8221;
said Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get aboard an&#8217; try it, Alexander,&#8221; said Job.
&#8220;Quick, man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Alexander Bludd stepped on. The pan tipped
fearfully, and the water ran over it; but when the
weight of the man and the boy was properly adjusted,
it seemed capable of bearing them both
across. They pushed off, and seemed to go well
enough; but when Alexander moved to put his
gaff in the water the pan tipped again. Donald
came near losing his footing. He moved nearer
the edge and the pan came to a level. They
paddled with all their strength, for the wind was
blowing against them, and there was need of
haste if three passages were to be made. Meantime
the gap had grown so wide that the wind
had turned the ripples into waves, which washed
over the pan as high as Donald&#8217;s ankles.</p>
<p>But they came safely across. Bludd stepped
swiftly ashore, and Donald pushed off. With
the wind in his favour he was soon once more at
the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Bill,&#8221; said North; &#8220;your turn next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, Job,&#8221; said Stevens. &#8220;Get
aboard yourself. The lad can&#8217;t come back again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re driftin&#8217; out too fast. He&#8217;s your lad, an&#8217;
you&#8217;ve the right to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I can come back,&#8221; said Donald. &#8220;Come
on, Bill! Be quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevens was a lighter man than Alexander
Bludd; but the passage was wider, and still
widening, for the pack had gathered speed.
When Stevens was safely landed he looked
back. A vast white shadow was all that he
could see. Job North&#8217;s figure had been merged
with the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Donald, b&#8217;y,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you got t&#8217; go back
for your father, but I&#8217;m fair feared you&#8217;ll
never&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a push, Bill,&#8221; said Donald.</p>
<p>Stevens caught the end of the gaff and pushed
the lad out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Donald,&#8221; he called.</p>
<p>When the pan touched the other side Job
North stepped aboard without a word. He was
a heavy man. With his great body on the ice-cake,
the difficulty of return was enormously increased,
as Donald had foreseen. The pan was
overweighted. Time and again it nearly shook
itself free of its load and rose to the surface.
North was near the centre, plying his gaff with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
difficulty, but Donald was on the extreme edge.
Moreover, the distance was twice as great as it
had been at first, and the waves were running
high, and it was dark.</p>
<p>They made way slowly. The pan often
wavered beneath them; but Donald was intent
upon the thing he was doing, and he was not
afraid. Then came the time&ndash;&ndash;they were but ten
yards off the standing edge&ndash;&ndash;when North struck
his gaff too deep into the water. He lost his
balance, struggled to regain it, failed&ndash;&ndash;and fell
off. Before Donald was awake to the danger,
the edge of the pan sank under him, and he, too,
toppled off.</p>
<p>Donald had learned to swim now. When he
came to the surface, his father was breast-high in
the water, looking for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all right, Donald?&#8221; said his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you reach the ice alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Donald, quietly.</p>
<p>Alexander Bludd and Bill Stevens helped them
up on the standing edge, and they were home
by the kitchen fire in half an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas bravely done, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said Job.</p>
<p>So Donald North learned that perils feared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
are much more terrible than perils faced. He
had a courage of the finest kind, in the following
days of adventure, now close upon him, had
young Donald.</p>

Ruddy Cove From the Mail-Boat, Makes the Acquaintance of Jimmie
Grimm and Billy Topsail, and Tells Them &#8217;E Wants to Go &#8217;Ome. In
Which, Also, the Way to Catastrophe Is Pointed</i></p>
<p>The mail-boat comes to Ruddy Cove in
the night, when the shadows are black
and wet, and the wind, blowing in from
the sea, is charged with a clammy mist. The
lights in the cottages are blurred by the fog.
They form a broken line of yellow splotches
rounding the harbour&#8217;s edge. Beyond is deep
night and a wilderness into which the wind
drives. In the morning the fog still clings
to the coast. Within the cloudy wall it is all
glum and dripping wet. When a veering wind
sweeps the fog away, there lies disclosed a world
of rock and forest and fuming sea, stretching
from the end of the earth to the summits of the
inland hills&ndash;&ndash;a place of ruggedness and hazy
distances; of silence and a vast, forbidding loneliness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>It was on such a morning that Bagg, the
London gutter-snipe, having been landed at
Ruddy Cove from the mail-boat the night before&ndash;&ndash;this
being in the fall before Donald North
played ferryman between the standing edge and
the floe&ndash;&ndash;it was on such a foggy morning, I say,
that Bagg made the acquaintance of Billy Topsail
and Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; Jimmie Grimm echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You blokes live &#8217;ere?&#8221; Bagg whined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This yer &#8217;<i>ome</i>?&#8221; pursued Bagg.</p>
<p>Billy nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht <i>I</i> was &#8217;ome!&#8221; sighed Bagg. &#8220;I say,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;which way&#8217;s &#8217;ome from &#8217;ere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Skipper &#8217;Zekiel&#8217;s cottage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Lun&#8217;on,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Billy answered. &#8220;You better
ask Uncle Tommy Luff. He&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bagg had been exported for adoption. The
gutters of London are never exhausted of their
product of malformed little bodies and souls;
they provide waifs for the remotest colonies of
the empire. So, as it chanced, Bagg had been
exported to Newfoundland&ndash;&ndash;transported from his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
native alleys to this vast and lonely place. Bagg
was scrawny and sallow, with bandy legs and
watery eyes and a fantastic cranium; and he
had a snub nose, which turned blue when a cold
wind struck it. But when he was landed from
the mail-boat he found a warm welcome, just the
same, from Ruth Rideout, Ezekiel&#8217;s wife, by
whom he had been taken for adoption.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Later in the day, old Uncle Tommy Luff, just in
from the fishing grounds off the Mull, where he
had been jigging for stray cod all day long, had
moored his punt to the stage-head, and he was
now coming up the path with his sail over his
shoulder, his back to the wide, flaring sunset.
Bagg sat at the turn to Squid Cove,
disconsolate. The sky was heavy with glowing
clouds, and the whole earth was filled with a
glory such as he had not known before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I arst the ol&#8217; beggar when &#8217;e gets
&#8217;ere?&#8221; mused Bagg.</p>
<p>Uncle Tommy looked up with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, mister,&#8221; piped Bagg, when the old
man came abreast, &#8220;which way&#8217;s &#8217;ome from
&#8217;ere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, b&#8217;y?&#8221; said Uncle Tommy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ome, sir. Which way is &#8217;ome from &#8217;ere?&#8221;</p>
<p>In that one word Bagg&#8217;s sickness of heart expressed
itself&ndash;&ndash;in the quivering, wistful accent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you &#8217;Zekiel Rideout&#8217;s lad?&#8221; said Uncle
Tommy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t yer make no mistake, mister,&#8221; said
Bagg, somewhat resentfully. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t nothink t&#8217;
nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knowed you was that lad,&#8221; Uncle Tommy
drawled, &#8220;when I seed the size o&#8217; you. Sure,
b&#8217;y, you knows so well as me where &#8217;Zekiel&#8217;s
place is to. &#8217;Tis t&#8217; the head o&#8217; Burnt Cove,
there, with the white railin&#8217;, an&#8217; the tater patch
aft o&#8217; the place where they spreads the fish.
Sure, you knows the way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean Lun&#8217;on, mister,&#8221; Bagg urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, home!&#8221; said Uncle Tommy. &#8220;When I
was a lad like you, b&#8217;y, just here from the
West Country, me fawther told me if I steered a
course out o&#8217; the tickle an&#8217; kept me starn fair for
the meetin&#8217;-house, I&#8217;d sure get home t&#8217; last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way, mister?&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Tommy pointed out to sea&ndash;&ndash;to that far
place in the east where the dusk was creeping up
over the horizon.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Home lies there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>Then Uncle Tommy shifted his sail to the
other shoulder and trudged on up the hill; and
Bagg threw himself on the ground and wept
until his sobs convulsed his scrawny little body.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go &#8217;ome!&#8221; he sobbed. &#8220;I want to
go &#8217;ome!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>No wonder that Bagg, London born and bred,
wanted to go home to the crowd and roar and
glitter of the streets to which he had been used.
It was fall in Ruddy Cove, when the winds are
variable and gusty, when the sea is breaking
under the sweep of a freshening breeze and yet
heaving to the force of spent gales. Fogs, persistently
returning with the east wind, filled the
days with gloom and dampness. Great breakers
beat against the harbour rocks; the swish and
thud of them never ceased, nor was there any
escape from it.</p>
<p>Bagg went to the fishing grounds with Ezekiel
Rideout, where he jigged for the fall run of cod;
and there he was tossed about in the lop, and
chilled to the marrow by the nor&#8217;easters. Many
a time the punt ran heeling and plunging for
the shelter of the harbour, with the spray falling
upon Bagg where he cowered amidships; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
once she was nearly undone by an offshore gale.
In the end Bagg learned consideration for the
whims of a punt and acquired an unfathomable
respect for a gust and a breaking wave.</p>
<p>Thus the fall passed, when the catching and
splitting and drying of fish was a distraction.
Then came the winter&ndash;&ndash;short, drear days, mere
breaks in the night, when there was no relief
from the silence and vasty space round about,
and the dark was filled with the terrors of snow
and great winds and loneliness. At last the
spring arrived, when the ice drifted out of the
north in vast floes, bearing herds of hair-seal
within reach of the gaffs of the harbour folk, and
was carried hither and thither with the wind.</p>
<p>Then there came a day when the wind gathered
the dumpers and pans in one broad mass and
jammed it against the coast. The sea, where it
had lain black and fretful all winter long, was
now covered and hidden. The ice stretched unbroken
from the rocks of Ruddy Cove to the
limit of vision in the east. And Bagg marvelled.
There seemed to be a solid path from Ruddy
Cove straight away in the direction in which
Uncle Tommy Luff had said that England lay.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the comfort and plenty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
his place with Aunt Ruth Rideout and Uncle
Ezekiel, Bagg still longed to go back to the
gutters of London.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go &#8217;ome,&#8221; he often said to Billy
Topsail and Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; Billy once demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Bagg replied. &#8220;I jus&#8217; want to
go &#8217;ome.&#8221;</p>
<p>At last Bagg formed a plan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Bagg, Unknown to Ruddy Cove, Starts for Home, and,
After Some Difficulty, Safely Gets There</i></p>
<p>Uncle Tommy Luff, coming up the
hill one day when the ice was jammed
against the coast and covered the sea as
far as sight carried, was stopped by Bagg at the
turn to Squid Cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, mister,&#8221; said Bagg, &#8220;which way was
you tellin&#8217; me Lun&#8217;on was from &#8217;ere?&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Tommy pointed straight out to the ice-covered
sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;That way?&#8221; asked Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight out o&#8217; the tickle with the meetin&#8217;-house
astarn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think a bloke could ever get there?&#8221; Bagg
inquired.</p>
<p>Uncle Tommy laughed. &#8220;If he kep&#8217; on
walkin&#8217; he&#8217;d strike it some time,&#8221; he answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure?&#8221; Bagg demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he kep&#8217; on walkin&#8217;,&#8221; Uncle Tommy repeated,
smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>This much may be said of the ice: the wind
which carries it inshore inevitably sweeps it out
to sea again, in an hour or a day or a week, as
it may chance. The whole pack&ndash;&ndash;the wide expanse
of enormous fragments of fields and
glaciers&ndash;&ndash;is in the grip of the wind, which, as all
men know, bloweth where it listeth. A nor&#8217;east
gale sets it grinding against the coast, but when
the wind veers to the west the pack moves out
and scatters.</p>
<p>If a man is caught in that great rush and
heaving, he has nothing further to do with his
own fate but wait. He escapes if he has strength
to survive until the wind blows the ice against
the coast again&ndash;&ndash;not else. When the Newfoundlander
starts out to the seal hunt he makes sure,
in so far as he can, that no change in the wind is
threatened.</p>
<p>Uncle Ezekiel Rideout kept an eye on the
weather that night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be you goin&#8217;, b&#8217;y?&#8221; said Ruth, looking up
from her weaving.</p>
<p>Ezekiel had just come in from Lookout Head,
where the watchers had caught sight of the seals,
swarming far off in the shadows.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s seals out there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
don&#8217;t know as us&#8217;ll go the night. &#8217;Tis like the
wind&#8217;ll haul t&#8217; the west.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do Uncle Tommy Luff say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That &#8217;twill haul t&#8217; the west an&#8217; freshen afore
midnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, then, you&#8217;ll not be goin&#8217;, b&#8217;y?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as anybody&#8217;ll go,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Looks a bit too nasty for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ezekiel put some pork and hard-bread
in his dunny bag, and made ready his
gaff and tow-lines, lest, by chance, the weather
should promise fair at midnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that young scamp?&#8221; said Ezekiel,
with a smile&ndash;&ndash;a smile which expressed a fine,
indulgent affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I wonder where he is?&#8221; said Ruth,
pausing in her work. &#8220;He&#8217;ve been gone more&#8217;n
an hour, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave un bide where he is so long as he
likes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Sure he must be havin&#8217; a bit o&#8217;
sport. &#8217;Twill do un good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ezekiel sat down by the fire and dozed.
From time to time he went to the door to watch
the weather. From time to time Aunt Ruth
listened for the footfalls of Bagg coming up the
path. After a long time she put her work away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
The moon was shining through a mist; so she
sat at the window, for from there she could see
the boy when he rounded the turn to the path.
She wished he would come home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down t&#8217; Topsail&#8217;s t&#8217; see what&#8217;s t&#8217; be
done about the seals,&#8221; said Ezekiel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep a lookout for the b&#8217;y,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was back in half an hour. &#8220;Topsail&#8217;s
gone t&#8217; bed,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Sure, no one&#8217;s goin&#8217;
out the night. The wind&#8217;s hauled round t&#8217; the
west, an&#8217; &#8217;twill blow a gale afore mornin&#8217;. The
ice is movin&#8217; out slow a&#8217;ready. Be that lad out
yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said Ruth, anxiously. &#8220;I wisht
he&#8217;d come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;wisht he would,&#8221; said Ezekiel.</p>
<p>Ruth went to the door and called Bagg by
name.</p>
<p>But there was no answer.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Offshore, four miles offshore, Bagg was footing
it for England as fast as his skinny little legs
would carry him. The way was hard&ndash;&ndash;a winding,
uneven path over the pack. It led round
clumpers, over ridges which were hard to scale,
and across broad, slippery pans. The frost had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
glued every fragment to its neighbour; for the
moment the pack formed one solid mass, continuous
and at rest, but the connection between
its parts was of the slenderest, needing only a
change of the wind or the ground swell of the
sea to break it everywhere.</p>
<p>The moon was up. It was half obscured by a
haze which was driving out from the shore, to
which quarter the wind had now fairly veered.
The wind was rising&ndash;&ndash;coming in gusts, in which,
soon, flakes of snow appeared. But there was
light enough to keep to the general direction out
from the coast, and the wind but helped Bagg
along.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got t&#8217; &#8217;urry up,&#8221; thought he.</p>
<p>The boy looked behind. Ruddy Cove was
within sight. He was surprised that the coast
was still so near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got t&#8217; &#8217;urry up a bit more,&#8221; he determined.</p>
<p>He was elated&ndash;&ndash;highly elated. He thought
that his old home was but a night&#8217;s journey
distant; at most, not more than a night and a
day, and he had more than food enough in his
pockets to last through that. He was elated;
but from time to time a certain regret entered in,
and it was not easily cast out. He remembered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
the touch of Aunt Ruth&#8217;s lips, and her arm,
which had often stolen about him in the dusk; and
he remembered that Uncle Ezekiel had beamed
upon him most affectionately, in times of mischief
and good works alike. He had been well
loved in Ruddy Cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I&#8217;d told Aunt Ruth,&#8221; Bagg thought.</p>
<p>On he trudged&ndash;&ndash;straight out to sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got t&#8217; &#8217;urry up,&#8221; thought he.</p>
<p>Again the affection of Aunt Ruth occurred to
him. She had been very kind; and as for Uncle
&#8217;Zeke&ndash;&ndash;why, nobody could have been kinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I <i>&#8217;ad</i> told Aunt Ruth,&#8221; Bagg regretted.
&#8220;Might o&#8217; said good-bye anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ice was now drifting out; but the wind
had not yet risen to that measure of strength
wherewith it tears the pack to pieces, nor had the
sea attacked it. There was a gap of two hundred
yards between the coast rocks and the edge of
the ice, but that was far, far back, and hidden
from sight. The pack was drifting slowly,
smoothly, still in one compact mass. Its motion
was not felt by Bagg, who pressed steadily on
toward England, eager again, but fast growing
weary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got t&#8217; &#8217;urry up,&#8221; thought he.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>But presently he must rest; and while he
rested the wind gathered strength. It went singing
over the pack, pressing ever with a stronger
hand upon its dumpers and ridges&ndash;&ndash;pushing it,
everywhere, faster and faster out to sea. The
pack was on the point of breaking in pieces
under the strain, but the wind still fell short of
the power to rend it. There was a greater volume
of snow falling; it was driven past in thin, swirling
clouds. Hence the light of the moon began
to fail. Far away, at the rim of the pack, the
sea was eating its way in, but the swish and crash
of its work was too far distant to be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t nothink t&#8217; nobody but Aunt Ruth,&#8221;
Bagg thought, as he rose to continue the tramp.</p>
<p>On he went, the wind lending him wings;
but at last his legs gave out at the knees, and
he sat down again to rest. This was in the lee
of a clumper, where he was comfortably sheltered.
He was still warm&ndash;&ndash;in a glow of heat,
indeed&ndash;&ndash;and his hope was still with him. So far
he had suffered from nothing save weariness.
So he began to dream of what he would do
when he got home, just as all men do when
they come near, once again, to that old place
where they were born. The wind was now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
a gale, blowing furiously; the pack was groaning
in its outlying parts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothink t&#8217; nobody,&#8221; Bagg grumbled, on his
way once more.</p>
<p>Then he stopped dead&ndash;&ndash;in terror. He had
heard the breaking of an ice-pan&ndash;&ndash;a great clap
and rumble, vanishing in the distance. The
noise was repeated, all roundabout&ndash;&ndash;bursting
from everywhere, rising to a fearful volume:
near at hand, a cracking; far off, a continuing
roar. The pack was breaking up. Each separate
part was torn from another, and the noise
of the rending was great. Each part ground
against its neighbour on every side. The
weaker pans were crushed like egg-shells.
Then the whole began to feel the heave of the
sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a earthquake!&#8221; thought Bagg. &#8220;I better
&#8217;urry up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked back over the way he had come&ndash;&ndash;searching
the shadows for Ruddy Cove. But
the coast was lost to sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be near acrost, now,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
&#8217;urry up.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he turned his back on Ruddy Cove and
ran straight out to sea, for he thought that England
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
was nearer than the coast he had left. He
was now upon a pan, both broad and thick&ndash;&ndash;stout
enough to withstand the pressure of the
pack. It was a wide field of ice, which the cold
of the far North, acting through many years, it
may be, had made strong. Elsewhere the pans
were breaking&ndash;&ndash;were lifting themselves out of
the press and falling back in pieces&ndash;&ndash;were being
ground to finest fragments. This mighty confusion
of noise and wind and snow and night,
and the upheaval of the whole world roundabout,
made the soul of Bagg shiver within him. It
surpassed the terrors of his dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I never <i>will</i> get &#8217;ome,&#8221; thought he.</p>
<p>Soon he came to the edge of the pan. Beyond,
where the pack was in smaller blocks, the
sea was swelling beneath it. The ice was all
heaving and swaying. He dared not venture
out upon this shifting ground. So he ran up
and down, seeking a path onward; but he discovered
none. Meantime, the parts of the pack
had fallen into easier positions; the noise of
crunching, as the one ground against the other,
had somewhat abated. The ice continued its
course outward, under the driving force of the
wind, but the pressure was relieved. The pans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
fell away from one another. Lakes and lanes of
water opened up. The pan upon which Bagg
chanced to find himself in the great break-up
soon floated free. There was now no escape
from it.</p>
<p>Bagg retreated from the edge, for the seas
began to break there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I was &#8217;ome again,&#8221; he sobbed.</p>
<p>This time he did not look towards England,
but wistfully back to Ruddy Cove.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The gale wasted away in the night. The next
day was warm and sunny on all that coast. An
ice-pack hung offshore from Fortune Harbour.
In the afternoon it began to creep in with a light
wind. The first pans struck the coast at dusk.
The folk of the place were on the Head, on the
lookout for the sign of a herd of seal. Just before
night fell they spied a black speck, as far
out from shore as their eyes could see.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be seals out there the morrow,&#8221; the
men were all agreed.</p>
<p>So they went home and prepared to set out at
dawn of the next day. In the night, the wind
swept the whole pack in, to the last lagging pan.
The ice was all jammed against the coast&ndash;&ndash;a firm,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
vast expanse, stretching to the horizon, and held
in place by the wind, which continued strong
and steady. The men of Fortune Harbour went
confidently out to the hunt. At noon, when they
were ten miles off the shore, they perceived the
approach of a small, black figure.</p>
<p>The meeting came soon afterwards, for the
folk of Fortune Harbour, being both curious and
quick to respond to need, made haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, mister,&#8221; said Bagg, briskly, addressing
old John Forsyth, &#8220;yer &#8217;aven&#8217;t got no &#8217;am, &#8217;ave
yer?&#8221;</p>
<p>The men of Fortune Harbour laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or nothink else, &#8217;ave yer?&#8221; Bagg continued,
hopefully. &#8220;I&#8217;m a bit &#8217;ungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said Forsyth. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a biscuit an&#8217;
a bit o&#8217; pork.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ave yer, now?&#8221; said Bagg. &#8220;Would yer
mind giv&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But his hands were already full. A moment
later his mouth was in the same condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you come out here?&#8221; said Forsyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swep&#8217; out,&#8221; said Bagg. &#8220;I say, mister,&#8221; he
added, between munches, &#8220;which way would yer
say my &#8217;ome was from &#8217;ere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your home?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ruddy Cove,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis fifteen mile up the coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ow would you get there quickest if yer
&#8217;ad to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care o&#8217; you, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said Forsyth.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll put you t&#8217; Ruddy Cove in a skiff, when
the ice goes out. Seems t&#8217; me,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you
must be the boy Ezekiel Rideout took. Isn&#8217;t
you Ezekiel Rideout&#8217;s boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet yer life I am,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Jimmie Grimm and Billy Topsail, Being Added Up and
Called a Man, Are Shipped For St. John&#8217;s, With Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay, Where They Fall In With Archie Armstrong, Sir Archibald&#8217;s
Son, and Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay Declines to Insure the &#8220;First
Venture&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Of course, Donald North, who had been
ferryman to his father, had no foolishly
romantic idea of his experience on that
pan of ice; nor had Jimmie Grimm, nor had
Billy Topsail. Donald North would not have
called it an adventure, nor himself a hero; he
would have said, without any affectation of
modesty, &#8220;Oh, that was jus&#8217; a little mess!&#8221;
The thing had come in the course of the day&#8217;s
work: that was all. Something had depended
upon him, and, greatly to his elation, he had
&#8220;made good.&#8221; It was no more to him than a
hard tackle to a boy of the American towns.
Any sound American boy&ndash;&ndash;any boy of healthy
courage and clean heart&ndash;&ndash;would doubtless have
taken Job North off the drifting floe; and Donald
North, for his part, would no doubt have made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the tackle and saved the goal&ndash;&ndash;though frightened
to a greenish pallor&ndash;&ndash;had he ever been face to
face with the necessity. Had he ever survived a
football game, he would have thought himself a
hero, and perhaps have boasted more than was
pleasant; but to have taken a larger chance
with his life on a pan of ice was so small and
usual a thing as presently to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Newfoundland boys are used to that.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It was still spring at Ruddy Cove&ndash;&ndash;two weeks
or more after Bagg came back to his real home&ndash;&ndash;when
Donald North&#8217;s friends, Billy Topsail
and Jimmie Grimm, fell into considerable peril
in a gale of wind off the Chunks. Even they&ndash;&ndash;used
to such adventures as they were&ndash;&ndash;called it
a narrow escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more o&#8217; that for <i>me</i>,&#8221; said Billy Topsail,
afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor me,&#8221; said Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll both o&#8217; you take all that comes your
way,&#8221; Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay put in, tartly.</p>
<p>It was aboard the <i>First Venture</i>, which Bill
o&#8217; Burnt Bay had as master-builder built at
Ruddy Cove for himself. She was to be his&ndash;&ndash;she
<i>was</i> his&ndash;&ndash;and he loved her from stem to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
stern. And she was his because Sir Archibald
Armstrong, the great St. John&#8217;s merchant and
ship-owner, had advanced the money to build
her in recognition of Skipper Bill&#8217;s courageous
rescue of Archie Armstrong, Sir Archibald&#8217;s only
son, in a great blizzard, on the sealing voyage
of the year before.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> At any rate, the <i>First
Venture</i> was Bill&#8217;s; and she was now afloat and
finished, rigged to the last strand of rope. To
say that Skipper Bill was proud of her does not
begin to express the way in which he loved her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, look you, Billy Topsail, and you, too,
Jimmie Grimm!&#8221; said he, gravely, one day,
beckoning the boys near.</p>
<p>The <i>First Venture</i> was lying at anchor in
the harbour, ready for her maiden voyage to
St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in need of a man aboard this here craft,&#8221;
Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay went on; &#8220;an&#8217; as there&#8217;s none
t&#8217; be had in this harbour I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of addin&#8217;
you two boys up an&#8217; callin&#8217; the answer t&#8217; the sum
a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht you would, Skipper Bill,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Two halves makes a whole,&#8221; Bill mused,
scratching his head in doubt. &#8220;Leastwise, so I
was teached.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They teach it in school,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>Billy Topsail grinned delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Bill declared, at last, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take you,
no matter what comes of it, for there&#8217;s nothing
else I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t quite complimentary; but the boys
didn&#8217;t mind.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the <i>First Venture</i> made St. John&#8217;s it
was still early enough in the spring of the year
for small craft to be at sea. When she was
ready to depart on the return voyage to Ruddy
Cove, the days were days of changeable weather,
of wind and snow, of fog and rain, of unseasonable
intervals of quiet sunshine. The predictions
of the wiseacres were not to be trusted; and, at
any rate, every forecast was made with a wag of
the head that implied a large mental reservation.
At sea it was better to proceed with caution.
To be prepared for emergencies&ndash;&ndash;to expect the
worst and to be ready for it&ndash;&ndash;was the part of
plain common sense. And Skipper Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay was well aware of this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>The <i>First Venture</i> lay in dock at St. John&#8217;s.
She was loaded for Ruddy Cove and the ports
beyond. Skipper Bill had launched himself as a
coastwise skipper&ndash;&ndash;master of the stout <i>First
Venture</i>, carrying freight to the northern settlements
at a fair rate for all comers. The hold was
full to the deck; and the deck itself was cumbered
with casks and cases, all lashed fast in
anticipation of a rough voyage. It was a miscellaneous
cargo: flour, beef, powder and shot,
molasses, kerosene, clothing&ndash;&ndash;such necessities,
in short, as the various merchants to whom the
cargo was consigned could dispose of to the
people of the coast, and such simple comforts as
the people could afford.</p>
<p>She was a trim and stout little fore-and-aft
schooner of fifty tons burthen. The viewers had
awarded the government bounty without a
quibble. Old John Hulton, the chief of them&ndash;&ndash;a
terror to the slipshod master-builders&ndash;&ndash;had
frankly said that she was an honest little craft
from bowsprit to taffrail. The newspapers had
complimented Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, her builder, in
black and white which could not be disputed.
They had even called Skipper Bill &#8220;one of the
honest master-builders of the outports.&#8221; Nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
had they forgotten to add the hope that &#8220;in the
hands of Skipper William, builder and master,
the new craft will have many and prosperous
voyages.&#8221; By this praise, of course, Skipper
Bill was made to glow from head to foot with
happy gratification.</p>
<p>All the <i>First Venture</i> wanted was a fair wind out.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can leg it, sir,&#8221; Skipper Bill said to Sir
Archibald, running his eyes over the tall, trim
spars of the new craft; &#8220;an&#8217; once she gets t&#8217;
sea she&#8217;s got ballast enough t&#8217; stand up to a
sousing breeze. With any sort o&#8217; civil weather
she ought t&#8217; make Ruddy Cove in five days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d not drive her too hard,&#8221; said Sir Archibald,
who had come down to look at the new
schooner for a purpose.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay looked up in amazement.
This from the hard-sailing Sir Archibald!</p>
<p>&#8220;Not too hard,&#8221; Sir Archibald repeated.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, &#8220;that Mrs.
William had rather have you come safe than unexpected.
Be modest, Skipper Bill, and reef the
<i>Venture</i> when she howls for mercy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bargain t&#8217; reef her, sir,&#8221; Bill replied,
&#8220;when I thinks you would yourself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come, skipper!&#8221; Sir Archibald laughed.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay roared like the lusty sea-dog
he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve good reason for wishing you to go
cautiously,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, gravely.</p>
<p>Bill looked up with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve settled at Ruddy Cove, skipper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, sir,&#8221; Bill answered. &#8220;I moved the wife
t&#8217; Ruddy Cove when I undertook t&#8217; build the
<i>Venture</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of sending Archie down to
spend the summer,&#8221; said Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay beamed largely and delightedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; Sir Archibald went on, with
a little grin, &#8220;that Mrs. Skipper William would
care to take him in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Care?</i>&#8221; Skipper Bill exclaimed. &#8220;Why,
sir, &#8217;twould be as good as takin&#8217; her a stick o&#8217;
peppermint.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come aboard this afternoon,&#8221; said Sir
Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be second mate o&#8217; the <i>Venture</i>,&#8221; Bill
declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, presently,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll be wanting this craft insured, I suppose?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, sir,&#8221; Bill drawled.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald frowned. &#8220;No trouble for me
to take the papers out for you,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; Bill explained, &#8220;I was allowin&#8217;
t&#8217; save that there insurance money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Penny wise and pound foolish,&#8221; said Sir
Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; drawled Skipper Bill, &#8220;I&#8217;ll manage t&#8217;
get her t&#8217; Ruddy Cove well enough. Anyhow,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;&#8217;twon&#8217;t be wind nor sea that will
wreck my schooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you will,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, shortly;
&#8220;the craft&#8217;s yours.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Archie Armstrong came aboard that afternoon&ndash;&ndash;followed
by two porters and two trunks. He
was Sir Archibald&#8217;s son; there was no doubt
about that: a fine, hardy lad&ndash;&ndash;robust, straight,
agile, alert, with his head carried high; merry,
quick-minded, ready-tongued, fearless in wind
and high sea. His hair was tawny, his eyes blue
and wide and clear, his face broad and good-humoured.
He was something of a small dandy,
too, as the two porters and the two trunks might
have explained. The cut of his coat, the knot in
his cravat, the polish on his boots, the set of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
knickerbockers, were always matters of deep
concern to him. But this did not interfere with
his friendship with Billy Topsail, the outport
boy. That friendship had been formed in times
of peril and hardship, when a boy was a boy,
and clothes had had nothing to say in the
matter.</p>
<p>Archie bounded up the gangplank, crossed
the deck in three leaps and stuck his head into
the forecastle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, Billy Topsail!&#8221; he roared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, yourself!&#8221; Billy shouted. &#8220;Come
below, Archie, an&#8217; take a look at Jimmie
Grimm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm was at once taken into the

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the Cook Smells Smoke, and the &#8220;First Venture&#8221; In
a Gale of Wind Off the Chunks, Comes Into Still Graver Peril,
Which Billy Topsail Discovers</i></p>
<p>Skipper Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay got the <i>First
Venture</i> under way at dawn of the next
day. It was blowing a stiff breeze. A
fine, fresh wind was romping fair to the northwest,
where, far off, Ruddy Cove lay and Mrs.
Skipper William waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; Skipper Bill mused, as the schooner
slipped through the narrows, &#8220;that that there
insurance wouldn&#8217;t o&#8217; done much harm anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an abrupt change of weather. It
came without warning; and there was no hint
of apology to the skipper of the <i>First Venture</i>.
When the schooner was still to the s&#8217;uth&#8217;ard of
the dangerous Chunks, but approaching them,
she was beating laboriously into a violent and
capricious head wind. Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, giving
heed to Sir Archibald&#8217;s injunction, kept her well
off the group of barren islands. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
mere rocks, scattered widely. Some of them
showed their forbidding heads to passing craft;
others were submerged, as though lying in wait.
It would be well to sight them, he knew, that
he might better lay his course; but he was
bound that no lurking rock should &#8220;pick up&#8221;
his ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow or other,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;I wisht I
<i>had</i> took out that there insurance.&#8221;</p>
<p>At dusk it began to snow. What with this
thick, blinding cloud driving past, shrouding
the face of the sea, and what with the tumultuous
waves breaking over her, and what with the
roaring gale drowning her lee rail, the <i>First
Venture</i> was having a rough time of it. Skipper
Bill, with his hands on the wheel, had the
very satisfactory impression, for which he is not
to be blamed, that he was &#8220;a man.&#8221; But when,
at last, the <i>First Venture</i> began to howl for mercy
in no uncertain way, he did not hesitate to waive
the wild joy of &#8220;driving&#8221; for the satisfaction of
keeping his spars in the sockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better call the hands, Tom!&#8221; he shouted to
the first hand. &#8220;We&#8217;ll reef her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom put his head into the forecastle. The
fire in the little round stove was roaring lustily;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
and the swinging lamp filled the narrow place
with warm light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out with you, lads!&#8221; Tom cried. &#8220;All
hands on deck t&#8217; reef the mains&#8217;l!&#8221;</p>
<p>Up they tumbled; and up tumbled Archie
Armstrong, and up tumbled Jimmie Grimm, and
up tumbled Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blowin&#8217; some,&#8221; thought Archie. &#8220;Great
sailin&#8217; breeze. What&#8217;s he reefin&#8217; for?&#8221;</p>
<p>The great sail was obstinate. Ease the
schooner as Skipper Bill would, it was still hard
for his crew of two men, three lads and a cook
to grasp and confine the canvas. Meantime, the
schooner lurched along, tossing her head, digging
her nose into the frothy waves. A cask on
the after deck broke its lashings, pursued a
mad and devastating career fore and aft, and
at last went spinning into the sea. Skipper Bill
devoutly hoped that nothing else would get
loose above or below. He cast an apprehensive
glance into the darkening cloud of snow ahead.
There was no promise to be descried. And to
leeward the first islands of the Chunks, which
had been sighted an hour ago, had disappeared
in the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lively with that mains&#8217;l, lads!&#8221; Skipper Bill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
shouted, lifting his voice above the wind. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
reef the fores&#8217;l!&#8221;</p>
<p>The crew had been intent upon the task in
hand. Not a man had yet smelled smoke. And
they continued to wrestle with the obstinate sail,
each wishing, heartily enough, to get the dirty-weather
job well done, and to return to the comfort
of the forecastle. It was the cook who first
paused to sniff&ndash;&ndash;to sniff again&ndash;&ndash;and to fancy he
smelled smoke. But a gust of wind at that moment
bellied his fold of the sail, and he forgot
the dawning suspicion in an immediate tussle to
reduce the disordered canvas. A few minutes
more of desperate work and the mainsail was
securely reefed; but these were supremely momentous
intervals, during which the fate of the
<i>First Venture</i> was determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;All stowed, sir!&#8221; Archie Armstrong shouted
to the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get at that fores&#8217;l, then!&#8221; was the order.</p>
<p>With the customary, &#8220;Ay, ay, sir!&#8221; shouted
cheerily, in the manner of good men and willing
lads, the crew ran forward.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill remembers that the cook tripped
and went sprawling into the lee scupper; and
that he scrambled out of the water with a laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>It was the last laugh aboard the <i>First Venture</i>;
for the condition of the schooner was then instantly
discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221; screamed Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>The <i>First Venture</i> was all ablaze forward.</p>

</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the &#8220;First Venture&#8221; All Ablaze Forward, Is Headed
For the Rocks and Breakers of the Chunks, While Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay and His Crew Wait for the Explosion of the Powder in Her
Hold. In Which, Also, a Rope Is Put to Good Use</i></p>
<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>A cloud of smoke broke from the
forecastle and was swept off by the
wind. A tongue of red flame flashed upward
and expired. Skipper Bill did not need the
cries of terror and warning to inform him. The
<i>First Venture</i> was afire! And she was not only
afire; she was off the Chunks in a gale of wind
and snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aft, here, one o&#8217; you!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Billy Topsail took the wheel, the
skipper plunged into the forecastle. It was a
desperate intention. He was back in a moment,
singed and gasping. But in that interval he
had made out that the forecastle stove, in some
violent lurch of the schooner, had broken loose,
and had been bandied about, distributing red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
coals in every part. He had made out, moreover,
that the situation of the schooner was
infinitely perilous, if not, indeed, quite beyond
hope. The forecastle was all ablaze. In five
minutes it would be a furnace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re lost!&#8221; Jimmie Grimm cried, staring at
the frothy waves running past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Archie grimly replied.</p>
<p>They were all of heart and strength and ingenuity;
and they worked with all their might.
But the buckets of water, and the great seas,
which Skipper Bill, in desperation, deliberately
shipped, made little impression. It was soon
evident that the little <i>First Venture</i> was doomed.
Meantime, the skipper had brought her before
the wind, and she was now flying towards the
inhospitable Chunks. The skipper was less concerned
for his schooner than for the lives of his
crew. The ship was already lost; the crew&ndash;&ndash;well,
how <i>could</i> the crew survive the rocks and
gigantic breakers of the Chunks?</p>
<p>It was the only hope. No small boat could
for a moment live in the sea that was running.
The schooner must be beached on the Chunks.
There was no other refuge. But how beach her?
It was a dark night, with the snow flying thick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Was it possible to sight a black, low-lying rock?
There was nothing for it but to drive with the
wind in the hope of striking. There were many
islands; she might strike one. But would it
really be an island, whereon a man might crawl
out of reach of the sea? or would it be a rock
swept by the breakers? Chance would determine
that. Skipper Bill was powerless.</p>
<p>But would she make the Chunks before she
was ablaze from stem to stern? Again, the
skipper was powerless; he could do no more
than give her all the wind that blew.</p>
<p>So he ordered the reefs shaken out&ndash;&ndash;and
waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said the skipper, presently, to the first
hand, &#8220;was it you stowed the cargo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause. Archie Armstrong and
Jimmie Grimm, aft near the wheel, wondered
why the skipper had put the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; where,&#8221; the skipper asked, quietly, &#8220;did
you put the powder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For&#8217;ard, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How far for&#8217;ard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair up against the forecastle bulkhead!&#8221;</p>
<p>The appalling significance of this was plain to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
the crew. The bulkhead was a thin partition
dividing the forecastle from the hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archie,&#8221; Skipper Bill drawled, &#8220;you better
loose the stays&#8217;l sheet. She ought t&#8217; do better
than this.&#8221; He paused. &#8220;Fair against the forecastle
bulkhead?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Tom, you
better get the hatch off, an&#8217; see what you&#8217;re able
t&#8217; do about gettin&#8217; them six kegs o&#8217; powder
out. No&ndash;&ndash;bide here!&#8221; he added. &#8220;Take the
wheel again, Billy. Get that hatch off, some o&#8217;
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the skipper himself who dropped into
the hold. The cargo was packed tight. Heavy
barrels of flour, puncheons of molasses, casks of
pork and beef, lay between the skipper and the
powder. He crawled forward, wriggling in the
narrow space between the freight and the deck.
No fire had as yet entered the hold; but the place
was full of stifling smoke. It was apparent that
the removal of the powder would be the labour
of hours; and there were no hours left for labour.
The skipper could stand the smoke no longer.
He retreated towards the hatch. How long it
would be before the fire communicated itself to
the cargo&ndash;&ndash;how long it would be before the explosion
of six kegs of powder would scatter the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
wreck of the <i>First Venture</i> upon the surface of
the sea&ndash;&ndash;no man could tell. But the end was
inevitable.</p>
<p>Anxious questions greeted the skipper when
again he stood upon the wind-swept deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Close the hatch,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance, sir?&#8221; Archie asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, b&#8217;y.&#8221;</p>
<p>The forecastle was already closed. There was
no gleam of fire anywhere to be seen. The
bitter wind savoured of smoke; nothing else betrayed
the schooner&#8217;s peril.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, get you all back aft!&#8221; was the skipper&#8217;s
command. &#8220;Keep her head as it points.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the crew had crept away to the place
remotest from the danger point, Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay went forward to keep a lookout for the
rocks and breakers. The burning forecastle
was beneath his feet; he could hear the crackling
of the fire; and the smoke, rising now more
voluminously, troubled his nostrils and throat.
It was pitch dark ahead. There was no blacker
shadow of land, no white flash of water, to give
him hope. It seemed as though an unbroken
expanse of sea lay before the labouring <i>First
Venture</i>. But the skipper knew to the contrary;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
somewhere in the night into which he stared&ndash;&ndash;somewhere
near, and, momentarily, drawing
nearer&ndash;&ndash;lay the Chunks. He wondered if the
<i>First Venture</i> would strike before the explosion
occurred. It must be soon, he knew. The
possibility of being off the course did not trouble
him.</p>
<p>Soon the seams of the deck began to open.
Smoke poured out in thickening clouds. Points
of light, fast changing to lines of flame, warned
the skipper that he must retreat. It was not,
however, until heat and smoke and the certain
prospect of collapse compelled him, that he
joined the crew. He was not a spectacular
hero; when common sense dictated return, he
obeyed without delay, and without maudlin
complaint. Without a word he took the wheel
from Billy Topsail&#8217;s hands, and without a word
he kept the schooner on her course. There was
no need of command or advice; men and boys
knew their situation and their duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be long,&#8221; said the cook.</p>
<p>There was now a glow of red light above the
forecastle. The fire was about to break through.
It was not hard to surmise that the collapse of
the bulkhead was imminent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; the fidgety cook repeated. &#8220;It
can&#8217;t be long, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed long. Minute after minute passed,
each of incredible length, while the <i>First Venture</i>
staggered forward, wildly pitching through the
seas. At last, the flames broke out of the forecastle
and illuminated the deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not long, now!&#8221; the cook whimpered. &#8220;It
<i>can&#8217;t</i> be!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nor was it. The <i>First Venture</i> struck. She
was upon the rocks before the skipper was well
aware that breakers lay ahead. Her bow fell,
struck, was lifted, fell again, and fastened itself.
The next wave flung the schooner broadside.
The third completed the turn. She lay with her
head pointing into the wind. Her stern, where
the crew stood waiting for the end, rose and fell
on the verge of a great breaker. Beyond was a
broken cliff, rising to unwashed heights, which
the snow had begun to whiten. The bow was
lifted clear of the waves; the stern was awash.
A space of white water lay between the schooner
and the shore.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay let go his grip on the wheel.
There was but one thing to do. Many a skipper
had done it before; but never before had there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
been such desperate need of haste. The fire
still burned lustily; and the forecastle was high
out of the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; the skipper shouted, &#8220;it&#8217;s
the first hand&#8217;s turn next.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had fastened the end of a coil of rope about
his waist. Now he stood swaying on the taffrail.
By the light of the fire&ndash;&ndash;uncertain and dull&ndash;&ndash;he
must act. He leaped a moment after the next
wave had slipped under the stern&ndash;&ndash;when, in the
current, he should reach the rocks just after the
wave had broken. The crew waited a long time.
Many a glance was cast forward; it seemed to
them all, such headway had the fire made, that
the six kegs of powder must explode the very
next instant. No sign came from the skipper;
and no sight of him could be caught. They
paid out the rope&ndash;&ndash;and waited. The rope was
for a long time loose in their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s landed!&#8221; cried Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>The rope was hauled taut. Upon the rocks,
out of reach of the sea, the figure of the skipper
could be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;One at a time!&#8221; Skipper Bill shouted.</p>
<p>And one at a time they went&ndash;&ndash;decently and in
order, like true Newfoundland sailors, Tom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Rook, the first hand, the last of all. When they
were all ashore, they scrambled like mad up the
cliff; and they were no more than out of danger
when the <i>First Venture</i> was blown to atoms.
There was a flash, a deafening roar&ndash;&ndash;and darkness;
broken only by the spluttering splinters of
the little craft.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>That night, from Heart&#8217;s Harbour, the folk
observed a ship afire, running in towards the
Chunks. To the report they sent immediately
to St. John&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;there happens fortunately to be a
government telegraph station at Heart&#8217;s Harbour&ndash;&ndash;they
added, later, that she had blown up.
But from St. John&#8217;s the salvage-tug <i>Hurricane</i>
was dispatched into the stormy sea in search of
the survivors; and on the second day following
she picked up Skipper Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay and his
crew.</p>
<p>Next day they were in St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I&#8217;d took your advice about the insurance,
sir,&#8221; broken-hearted Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay said
to Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald laughed. &#8220;I took it for you,&#8221;
said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Skipper Bill exploded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I insured the <i>First Venture</i> on my own responsibility,&#8221;
Sir Archibald replied. &#8220;You shall
build the <i>Second Venture</i> at Ruddy Cove next
winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie Armstrong and Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, with
the lads and men of the lost <i>First Venture</i>, went
back to Ruddy Cove by rail and the mail-boat.</p>

<p>David Grey, a bent old fellow, who was now
long &#8220;past his labour,&#8221; as they say in Newfoundland,
sat within hearing. Boy and man he
had been in the service of the Hudson Bay
Company, as hunter, clerk, trader, explorer, factor;
and here, on the coast where he had been
born, he had settled down to spend the rest of
his days. He was not an ignorant man, but, on
the contrary, an intelligent one, educated by
service, wide evening study of books, and hard
experience in the great wildernesses of the Canadian
Northwest, begun, long ago, when he was
a lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make me think of Donald McLeod,&#8221;
said he.</p>
<p>The boys drew near.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It was long ago,&#8221; David went on. &#8220;Long,
long ago,&#8221; the old man repeated. &#8220;It was &#8217;way
back in the first half of the last century, for I was
little more than a boy then. McLeod was factor
at Fort Refuge, a remote post, situated three
hundred miles or more to the northeast of Lake
Superior, but now abandoned. And a successful,
fair-dealing trader he was, but so stern and
taciturn as to keep both his helpers and his half-civilized
customers in awe of him. It was deep
in the wilderness&ndash;&ndash;not the wilderness as you
boys know it, where a man might wander night
and day without fear of wild beast or savage,
but a vast, unexplored place, with dangers lurking
everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Grey,&#8217; he said to me when I reported for
duty, fresh from headquarters, &#8216;if you do your
duty by me, I&#8217;ll do mine by you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll try to,&#8217; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;When you know me better,&#8217; said McLeod,
with quiet emphasis, &#8216;you&#8217;ll know that I stand
by my word.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;We dealt, of course, with the Indians, who,
spring and fall, brought their furs to the fort, and
never failed to remain until they had wasted
their earnings in the fashion that best pleased
their fancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even then the Indians were degenerate, given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
over to idleness and debauchery; but they were
not so far sunk in these habits as are the dull,
lazy fellows who sell you the baskets and beaded
moccasins that the squaws make to-day. They
were superstitious, malicious, revengeful, and
they were almost in a condition of savagery, for
the only law they knew was the law our guns
enforced. Some authority was vested in the
factor, and he was not slow to exert it when a
flagrant offense was committed near by.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s no band of Indians in these parts,&#8217;
I was told, &#8216;that can scare McLeod. He&#8217;ll see
justice done for and against them as between
man and man.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fort Refuge was set in a wide clearing. It
was built of logs and surrounded by a high,
stout stockade. Admittance to the yard was by
a great gate, which was closed promptly at sundown,
and always strongly barred. We had no
garrison regularly stationed there to defend us.
In all, it may be, we could muster nine men&ndash;&ndash;McLeod,
two clerks, and a number of stout
fellows who helped handle the stores. Moreover,
were our gate to be closed and our fort surrounded
by a hostile force, we should be utterly
cut off from communication with those quarters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
whence relief might come. We had the company&#8217;s
wares to guard, and we knew that once we
were overcome, whatever the object of the attack,
the wares and our lives would be lost together.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But we can stand a long siege,&#8217; I used to
think; and indeed there was good ground for
comfort in that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our stockade was impregnable to an attack
by force, no doubt; but as it soon appeared, it
was no more than a paper ribbon before the
wily strategy of the Indians. One night, when
I had shut the gates and dropped the bars, I
heard a long-drawn cry&ndash;&ndash;a scream, in which it
was not hard to detect the quality of terror and
great stress. It came, as I thought, from the
edge of the forest. When it was repeated, near
at hand, my heart went to my mouth, for I
knew that a band of Indians was encamped
beyond, and had been carousing for a week
past. Then came a knocking at the gate&ndash;&ndash;a
desperate pounding and kicking.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me in! Open! Open!&#8217; I heard a
man cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had my hands on the bar to lift it and
throw open the gate when McLeod came out of
his house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop!&#8217; he shouted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I withdrew from the gate. He approached,
waved me back, and put his own hand on the
bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who&#8217;s there?&#8217; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let me in, McLeod. It&#8217;s Landley. Quick!
Open the gate, or I&#8217;ll be killed!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;McLeod&#8217;s hesitation vanished. He opened
the gate. A man stumbled in. Then the gate
was shut with a bang.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s this about, Landley?&#8217; McLeod said,
sternly. &#8216;What trouble have you got yourself
into now?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew Landley for a white man who had
abandoned himself to a shiftless, vicious life with
the Indians. He had sunk lower, even, than
they. He was an evil, worthless, ragged fellow,
despised within the fort and respected nowhere.
But while he stood there, gasping and terror-stricken,
I pitied him; and it may be McLeod
himself was stirred by the mere kinship of colour.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Speak up, man!&#8217; he commanded. &#8216;What
have you done?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve done no wrong,&#8217; Landley whimpered.
&#8216;Buffalo Horn&#8217;s young son has died, and they
put the blame on me. They say I&#8217;ve cast the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
evil eye on him. They say I killed him with a
spell. You know me, McLeod. You know I
haven&#8217;t got the evil eye. Don&#8217;t turn me out,
man. They&#8217;re coming to kill me. Don&#8217;t give
me up. You know I&#8217;m not blood-guilty. You
know me. You know I haven&#8217;t got the evil
eye.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tush, man!&#8217; said McLeod. &#8216;Is that all
the trouble?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s all!&#8217; Landley cried. &#8216;I&#8217;ve done
no harm. Don&#8217;t give me up to them.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I won&#8217;t,&#8217; McLeod said, positively. &#8216;You&#8217;re
safe here until they prove you blood-guilty. I&#8217;ll
not give you up.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Old David Grey paused; and Jimmie demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they give un up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was they <i>wild</i> Indians?&#8221; Bagg gasped.</p>
<p>David laughed. &#8220;You just wait and see,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which There Are Too Many Knocks At the Gate, a Stratagem
Is Successful, Red Feather Draws a Tomahawk, and an Indian Girl
Appears On the Scene</i></p>
<p>&#8220;McLeod turned on his heel and went
to the shop,&#8221; David continued;
&#8220;and when he had ordered a watch
to be kept on the clearing on all sides, we devoted
ourselves to the matter in hand&ndash;&ndash;the preparation
of the regular quarterly statement for
the officials at headquarters. But as we laboured,
hatchets, knives and the cruel, evil faces of the
savages, by whom, as I chose to think, we were
threatened, mixed themselves with the figures, to
my bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon the dusk came, and while I trimmed
and lighted the candles in the shadowy outer
room there seemed to be shapes in the corners
which I had never seen there in quieter times.
McLeod, however, was unperturbed. He had
forgotten all about the numerous band which he
stood ready to defy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do you think there is danger?&#8217; said I.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Danger?&#8217; said he. &#8216;From what?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Buffalo Horn&#8217;s band,&#8217; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nonsense!&#8217; said he. &#8216;What is that last total?
There seems to be a shilling and sixpence
missing here.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;At that moment one of the helpers came in.
He was visibly excited&ndash;&ndash;like a man who bears
tidings.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Red Feather is at the gate,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Is he alone?&#8217; said McLeod.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, sir. We made sure of that.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fetch him here,&#8217; said the factor, calmly.
&#8216;Take Tom and Tobias to the gate, and don&#8217;t
let Red Feather hold it open.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Red Feather was soon brought in. He was
the chief of the band, an old, crafty Indian, chief
in name, but inferior in authority to Buffalo
Horn, who was chief in fact. McLeod continued
his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us talk,&#8217; said Red Feather, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;He spoke in his own tongue, which I shall
interpret freely for you. McLeod put his pen
aside and faced about.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What have we to talk about?&#8217; he asked.
&#8216;The trading is done. You have your supplies.
There is no business between us.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We have the white man to talk about,&#8217; said
Red Feather. &#8216;He has killed a child of our
tribe, and you have given him refuge here. He
has killed the son of Buffalo Horn with the evil
eye. He must be put to death.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know this man,&#8217; said McLeod. &#8216;He has
not the evil eye. He has killed no man, and he
shall not be given up.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;His life is forfeit to the tribe.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;His life is in my keeping. I have said that
he shall not lose it. Am I the man to break my
word?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You have kept your word between us,&#8217; said
Red Feather. &#8216;You are not the man to break
your word.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What business, then, lies between us? Our
talk is done.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;The guard at the gate interrupted. &#8216;There
is a man knocking at the gate,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is my brother,&#8217; said Red Feather. &#8216;He
comes to join the talk. Let him in.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Open the gate,&#8217; said McLeod.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was growing dark. I went with the
guard to admit the brother of Red Feather.
Dusk had fallen over the clearing. The sky was
overcast; in half an hour it would be deep night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
the clearing one with the forest. But we opened
the gate. A tall Indian stalked in. He was
alone, and I knew him for the brother of Red
Feather. I followed him to the shop, making
sure first that the bar was in place.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us have the white man,&#8217; he said to
McLeod. &#8216;Let the peace between us continue.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;McLeod perceived the threat. He was not
a rash man. He had no wish to provoke a conflict,
but he had no thought of surrendering the
refugee. As for me, my trust was in the stockade.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will talk with the white man,&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The factor was gone for half an hour. He
secreted Landley, inspected the defenses, gathered
the women and children in the blockhouse,
and returned to the council.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The white man is not blood-guilty,&#8217; he
said, proudly. &#8216;I have promised him protection
and he shall have it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Again the helper came. &#8216;There is another
knock at the gate,&#8217; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Who is there?&#8217; said McLeod.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s so dark I can&#8217;t see,&#8217; said the helper.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The man is my cousin,&#8217; said Red Feather.
&#8216;He has come to talk with us. Let him in,
for he is a wise man and may help us.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Open the gate,&#8217; said McLeod.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sat silent, waiting for the cousin of Red
Feather, the wise man who might help us. I
heard the rattle of the bar as the helper lifted
it, then the creak of the gate. Then a furious
outcry, a confusion of howls and screams, a
war-whoop and a rush of feet. The Indians
were within the stockade. A moment later
they burst into the shop and advanced upon us,
uttering blood-curdling whoops and brandishing
their hatchets and knives. McLeod reached for
the musket above the desk, but before his fingers
touched it Red Feather caught him by the
arms, and with the help of the brother made
him prisoner. At the same instant I was
secured.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us strike! Let us strike!&#8217; the Indians
kept shouting, all the while dancing about us,
flourishing their weapons.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danger was real and terrible. We were
at the mercy of the band, and at that moment
I did not doubt that they were bent on murder
and pillage. There had been a cruel massacre
at Fort Pine but a few months before. The
story was fresh in my mind. That crime had
gone unpunished; nor was it likely that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
sufficient force would be sent west to give the
band their due. There was nothing now to
deter Red Feather&#8217;s men from committing a
similar outrage. We were remote from our
kind, on the edge of a wilderness into which
escape was a simple matter. Our guns, as I
have said, had been our law and defense, and
we were now utterly in the power of our
enemies.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us strike! Let us strike!&#8217; was the cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buffalo Horn had come in with the band.
It was soon evident that to the restraining
influence of his presence was due our respite.
He waved his braves back. They withdrew
and became quiet.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will you give the murderer of my child to
our tribe?&#8217; the chief said to McLeod.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is no longer mine to give,&#8217; said the factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will you give him to us in peace and forget
that he has gone with us?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;McLeod was still in the grasp of Red Feather
and his brother. Buffalo Horn was facing him.
Behind the chief, awaiting his signal, was the
band, with knives and hatchets in hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said McLeod.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tumult was renewed. The Indians advanced,
threatening the factor with their weapons
and crying out for his death. But McLeod was
not to be terrified.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us take the white man,&#8217; said Buffalo
Horn, lifting his hand for silence. &#8216;We have
no quarrel with you. Let all be as it was.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said McLeod. &#8216;I will never consent
to his murder.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us take him.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I said I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8217; said McLeod, &#8216;and I
won&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seemed to me that the end had come.
Buffalo Horn looked steadily into McLeod&#8217;s
eyes. McLeod gave him glance for glance. He
was ready to die for the word he had passed.
The Indian hesitated. It may be that he did
not want to precipitate the slaughter. Then he
turned, as if to give the signal. Before his
hand was raised, however, the daughter of the
Indian interpreter of the post pushed her way
through the band of braves and stood before
their chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Listen,&#8217; said she. &#8216;Have you come to rob
the great company of its goods?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said Buffalo Horn. &#8216;We have no
quarrel with the great company.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She was a slip of a girl, to whom, in sickness
and in health, McLeod had been unfailingly
kind. She knew no fear, and in intelligence
she was superior to all the other women of her
race I have known.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Have you come to take the life of this
man?&#8217; she went on, moving closer to Buffalo
Horn, and looking deep into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said the chief, &#8216;we have no quarrel
with this man. He is a good man, but he will
not deliver the murderer of my child.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Will you take his life because of that?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No; we will take his life because he will
betray our part in the death of the white man
whom he has tried to shelter.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There are others who might betray you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And their lives, also,&#8217; said Buffalo Horn,
composedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that had been implied was now expressed.
He was to massacre us all to shield
his tribe from the punishment that might follow
the discovery of his revenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You will lay waste the fort,&#8217; said the
interpreter&#8217;s daughter, &#8216;but will the ruins not
accuse you to the great company which this
man serves?&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We will be far away.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And will you never care to return to the
grounds you have hunted from childhood?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;To this Buffalo Horn made no reply. He
looked at the floor, his arms folded, and he was
silent for a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This man,&#8217; said the girl, touching McLeod
on the shoulder, &#8216;has dealt fairly by you. He
has kept his faith with you. He said that he
would provide you with food through the hard
seasons. Has he not done so?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He has kept faith with us,&#8217; said the chief.
&#8216;Therefore he is a good man.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He is a good man because he has kept faith
with you,&#8217; the girl said, eagerly. &#8216;Would you,
then, have him break faith with some other?
He has said to the white man, &#8220;I will not give
you up.&#8221; Would you have him break the word
he has passed? For if he breaks it once, will
he not break it again? If he should yield up
the white man, what security would you have
that he would provide for you through the next
hard season?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;He keeps his word,&#8217; said Buffalo Horn.
&#8216;He is a good man.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He made a sign to Red Feather to release
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
McLeod. Then he gathered his braves about
him, and stalking solemnly at their head, led
them out of the shop, over the courtyard and
through the gate. We were left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Leave the gate open, Tobias,&#8217; said McLeod.
&#8216;Come, boy,&#8217; to me, &#8216;let us get to work on the
quarterly statement again. This interruption
came at an awkward time. We&#8217;ll have to make
up for it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the end of David&#8217;s story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Jimmie Grimm and Master Bagg Are Overtaken by the
Black Fog in the Open Sea and Lose the Way Home While a Gale is
Brewing</i></p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm and Bagg, returning from
Birds&#8217; Nest Islands, were caught by the
black fog in the open sea. It had been
lowering all day. Dull clouds had hung in the
sky since early morning and had kept the waters
of the sea sombre. There was no wind&ndash;&ndash;not
the faintest breath or sigh. The harbour water
was still; and the open&ndash;&ndash;beyond the tickle rocks&ndash;&ndash;was
without a ripple or hint of ground swell.
A thick, gray mist crept out from the hills, late
in the afternoon, and presently obscured the
shore. Jimmie and Bagg were then off Mad
Mull. Two miles of flat sea and windless space
lay between the punt and the harbour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; t&#8217; be thick as mud,&#8221; Jimmie grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht we was more inshore,&#8221; said Bagg,
anxiously.</p>
<p>At dusk the fog was so thick that every landmark
had been blotted from sight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is <i>you</i> able t&#8217; see Mad Mull?&#8221; Jimmie demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I is <i>not</i>,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>Mad Mull was lost in the fog. It was the last
landmark. The tickle rocks, through which a
passage leads to the harbour, had long ago vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht we was home,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go an&#8217; get scared, Bagg,&#8221; Jimmie
laughed. &#8220;Never you fear. <i>I&#8217;ll</i> take <i>you</i>
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was hot, dark and damp&ndash;&ndash;a breathless
evening. There was a menace in the still air
and heat. A roll of thunder sounded from the
northeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low &#8217;twill blow afore long,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Urry up,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>Jimmie put a little more strength into the
rowing. The punt moved faster, but not fast
enough to please Bagg, who was terrified by the
fog, the thunder and the still, black water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never you fear,&#8221; Jimmie grumbled; &#8220;you&#8217;ll
get home afore the wind comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bagg wasn&#8217;t so sure of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; it <i>will</i> come,&#8221; Jimmie reflected. &#8220;I can
fair feel it on the way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>Jimmie pulled doggedly. Occasionally a
rumble of thunder came out of the northeast to
enliven his strokes. There was no wind, however,
as yet, except, perhaps, an adverse stirring
of the air&ndash;&ndash;the first hint of a gale. On and on
crept the punt. There was no lessening of the
heat. Jimmie and Bagg fairly gasped. They
fancied it had never been so hot before. But
Jimmie did not weaken at the oars; he was
stout-hearted and used to labour, and the punt
did not lag. On they went through the mist
without a mark to guide them. Roundabout was
a wall of darkening fog. It hid the whole world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must be gettin&#8217; close inshore,&#8221; said Jimmie,
at last, while he rested on his oars, quite
bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you stoppin&#8217; for?&#8221; Bagg demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems t&#8217; me,&#8221; said Jimmie, scratching his
head in a puzzled way, &#8220;that we ought t&#8217; be in
the tickle by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was evident, however, that they were not in
the tickle.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> There was no sign of the rocks on
either hand. Jimmie gazed about him in every
direction for a moment. He saw nothing except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
a circle of black water about the boat. Beyond
was the black wall of fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful queer,&#8221; thought he, as he dipped
his oars in the water again; &#8220;but I &#8217;low we
ought t&#8217; be in the harbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a louder clap of thunder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have that wind afore long,&#8221; mused
Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;You &#8217;aven&#8217;t gone an&#8217; lost your way, &#8217;ave
you?&#8221; Bagg inquired in a frightened voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful queer,&#8221; Jimmie replied. &#8220;We
<i>ought</i> t&#8217; be in the harbour by this time. I &#8217;low
maybe I been pullin&#8217; too far t&#8217; the nor&#8217;east.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you &#8217;aven&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bagg; &#8220;you been
pullin&#8217; too far t&#8217; the sou&#8217;east.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low not,&#8221; mused Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ave, too,&#8221; Bagg sniffed.</p>
<p>Jimmie was not quite sure, after all. He
wavered. Something seemed to be wrong. It
didn&#8217;t <i>feel</i> right. Some homing instinct told
him that the tickle rocks did not lie in the direction
in which the bow of the punt pointed. In
fact, the whole thing was queer&ndash;&ndash;very queer!
But he had not pulled too far to the southeast;
he was sure of that. Perhaps, too far to the
northeast. He determined to change his course.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Bagg,&#8221; said he, confidently, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take
you into harbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>A clap of thunder&ndash;&ndash;sounding near at hand&ndash;&ndash;urged
the boy on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht you would,&#8221; Bagg whimpered.</p>
<p>Jimmie turned the boat&#8217;s head. He wondered
if he had turned far enough. Then he fancied
he had turned too far. Why, of course, thought
he, he had turned too far! He swerved again
towards the original direction. This, however,
did not feel just right. Again he changed the
course of the boat. He wondered if the harbour
lay ahead. Or was it the open sea? Was he
pulling straight out from shore? Would the
big wind catch the little punt out of harbour?</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s she headin&#8217; now?&#8221; he asked Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;You turned too far,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not far enough,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>Jimmie rowed doggedly on the course of his
choosing for half an hour or more without
developing anything to give him a clue to their
whereabouts. Night added to the obscurity.
They might have been on a shoreless waste of
water for all that they were able to see. The
mist made the night impenetrable. Jimmie could
but dimly distinguish Bagg&#8217;s form, although he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
sat not more than five feet from him; soon he
could not see him at all. At last he lifted his
oars and looked over the bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where we is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more do I,&#8221; Bagg sobbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low we&#8217;re lost,&#8221; Jimmie admitted.</p>
<p>Just then the first gust of wind rippled the
water around the boat and went whistling into
the mist.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which it Appears to Jimmie Grimm and Master Bagg That
Sixty Seconds Sometimes Make More Than a Minute</i></p>
<p>Ruddy Cove is deep&ndash;&ndash;vastly deep&ndash;&ndash;except
in one part. That is in Burnt
Cove within the harbour. There at low
tide it is shallow. Rocks protrude from the
water&ndash;&ndash;dripping and covered with a slimy seaweed.
And Burnt Cove lies near the tickle to
the sea. You pass between the tickle rocks,
bear sharply to the right and are presently in the
cove. It is a big expanse, snugly sheltered; and
it shallows so slowly that there are many acres
of quiet water in which the little fellows of Ruddy
Cove learn to swim.</p>
<p>Ezekiel Rideout&#8217;s cottage was by Burnt Cove;
and Bagg wished most heartily that he were
there.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>But Bagg was at sea. And the punt was a
small one. It was not Jimmie Grimm&#8217;s fishing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
punt; it was a shallow little rodney, which
Jimmie&#8217;s father used for going about in when
the ice and seals were off the coast. It was so
small and light that it could be carried over the
pans of ice from one lane of open water to another.
And being small and light it was cranky.
It was no rough weather boat; nor was it a boat
to move very much about in, as both boys were
quite well aware.</p>
<p>Bagg heard Jimmie&#8217;s oars rattle in the row-locks
and the blades strike the water. The boat
moved forward. Jimmie began to row with all
his strength&ndash;&ndash;almost angrily. It was plain that
he was losing his temper. And not only did he
lose his temper; he had grown tired before he
regained it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Bagg,&#8221; said he; &#8220;you have a go at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll &#8217;ave a try,&#8221; Bagg agreed.</p>
<p>Jimmie let the oars swing to the side and Bagg
made ready to steady the little boat. Bagg
heard him rise. The boat rocked a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady!&#8221; Bagg gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady, yourself!&#8221; Jimmie retorted. &#8220;Think
I don&#8217;t know how t&#8217; get around in a rodney?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now so dark, what with night and fog,
that Bagg could not see Jimmie. But presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
he understood that Jimmie was on his feet waiting
for him to rise in his turn. They were to
exchange places. Bagg got to his feet, and,
with all the caution he could command, advanced
a step, stretching out his hands as he did
so. But Bagg had not been born on the coast
and was not yet master of himself in a boat. He
swayed to the left&ndash;&ndash;fairly lurched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a care!&#8221; Jimmie scolded.</p>
<p>Have you never, in deep darkness, suddenly
felt a loss of power to keep your equilibrium?
You open your eyes to their widest. Nothing is
to be seen. You have no longer a sense of perpendicularity.
You sway this way and that,
groping for something to keep you from falling.
And that is just what happened to Bagg. He
was at best shaky on his legs in a boat; and
now, in darkness and fear, his whole mind was
fixed on finding something to grasp with his
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is you ready?&#8221; asked Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh!&#8221; Bagg gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said Jimmie; &#8220;but mind what
you&#8217;re about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bagg made a step forward. Again the boat
rocked; again the darkness confused him, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
he had to stop to regain his balance. In the
pause it struck him with unpleasant force that he
could not swim. He was sure, moreover, that
the boat would sink if she filled. He wished he
had not thought of that. A third half-crawling
advance brought him within reach of Jimmie.
He caught Jimmie&#8217;s outstretched hand and drew
himself forward until they were very close.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>He had crept too far to the right. The boat
listed alarmingly. They caught each other about
the middle, and crouched down, waiting, rigid,
until she had come to an even keel.</p>
<p>Presently they were ready to pass each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>Bagg made the attempt to pass him. The
foothold was uncertain; the darkness was confusing.
He moved to the side, but so great was
his agitation that he miscalculated, and the boat
tipped suddenly under his weight. The water
swept over the gunwale. Bagg would have
fallen bodily from the punt had it not been for
Jimmie&#8217;s clutch on his arm. In the light they
might have steadied themselves; in the dark
they could not.</p>
<p>Jimmie drew Bagg back&ndash;&ndash;but too hurriedly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
too strongly, too far. The side of the boat over
which he had almost fallen leaped high in the
air and the opposite gunwale was submerged.
Jimmie released him, and Bagg collapsed into a
sitting posture in the bottom. Instinctively he
grasped the gunwales and frantically tried to
right the boat. He felt the water slowly curling
over.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s goin&#8217; down,&#8221; said Jimmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinkin&#8217;!&#8221; Bagg sobbed.</p>
<p>The boat sank very slowly, gently swaying
from side to side. Bagg and Jimmie could see
nothing, and all they could hear was the gurgle
and hissing of the water as it curled over the
gunwales and eddied in the bottom of the boat.
Bagg felt the water rise over his legs&ndash;&ndash;creep to
his waist&ndash;&ndash;rise to his chest&ndash;&ndash;and still ascend.
Through those seconds he was incapable of
action. He did not think; he just waited.</p>
<p>Jimmie wondered where the shore was. A
yard or a mile away? In which direction would
it be best to strike out? How could he help
Bagg? He must not leave Bagg to drown.
But how could he help him? What was the use
of trying, anyhow? If he could not row ashore,
how could he manage to swim ashore? And if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
he could not get ashore himself, how could he
help Bagg ashore?</p>
<p>Nothing was said. Neither boy breathed.
Both waited. And it seemed to both that the
water was slow in coming aboard. But the
water came. It came slowly, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;but
surely. It rose to Bagg&#8217;s shoulders&ndash;&ndash;to his
chin&ndash;&ndash;it seemed to be about to cover his mouth
and nostrils. Bagg already had a stifled sensation&ndash;&ndash;a
frantic fear of smothering; a wish to
breathe deep. But he did not stir; he could not
rise.</p>
<p>The boys felt a slight shock. The water rose
no more. There was a moment of deep silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;I &#8217;low we&#8217;ve grounded!&#8221; Jimmie
Grimm stuttered.</p>
<p>The silence continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sure is!&#8221; Jimmie cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-wh-where &#8217;ave we got to?&#8221; Bagg gasped,
his teeth chattering with the fright that was not
yet passed.</p>
<p>Silence again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, there!&#8221; came a voice from near at
hand in the foggy night. &#8220;What you boys
doin&#8217; out there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in Burnt Cove,&#8221; said Jimmie, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
amazement, to Bagg. &#8220;&#8217;Tis Uncle Zeke&#8217;s voice&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;,
ay, look!&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s the cottage light on the
hill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re comin&#8217; ashore, Uncle Zeke,&#8221; Bagg
shouted.</p>
<p>The boat had grounded in less than three feet
of water. Jimmie had brought her through the
tickle without knowing it. The boys emptied
her and dragged her ashore just as the rain and
wind came rushing from the open sea.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Jimmie used to say with a laugh:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixty seconds sometimes makes more than a
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet yer life!&#8221; Bagg would add.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Archie Armstrong Joins a Piratical Expedition and
Sails Crested Seas to Cut Out the Schooner &#8220;Heavenly Home&#8221;</i></p>
<p>It was quite true that Archie Armstrong
could speak French; it was just as true, as
Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay observed, that he could
jabber it like a native. There was no detecting
a false accent. There was no hint of an awkward
Anglo-Saxon tongue in his speech. There
was no telling that he was not French born and
Paris bred. Archie&#8217;s French nurse and cosmopolitan-English
tutor had taken care of that.
The boy had pattered French with the former
since he had first begun to prattle at all.</p>
<p>And this was why Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay proposed
a piratical expedition to the French islands of
Miquelon which lie off the south coast of Newfoundland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t ye go, b&#8217;y?&#8221; he pleaded.</p>
<p>Archie laughed until his sides ached.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now!&#8221; Bill urged; &#8220;there&#8217;s like t&#8217; be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
a bit of a shindy that Sir Archibald hisself would
be glad t&#8217; have a hand in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis sheer piracy!&#8221; Archie chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis nothin&#8217; of the sort!&#8221; the indignant
Skipper William protested. &#8220;&#8217;Tis but a poor
man takin&#8217; his own from thieves an&#8217; robbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been to Saint Pierre?&#8221;
Archie asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That I has!&#8221; Skipper Bill ejaculated; &#8220;an&#8217;
much t&#8217; the grief o&#8217; Saint Pierre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve a jail there, I&#8217;m told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure &#8217;tis like home t&#8217; me,&#8221; said Skipper Bill.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been in it; an&#8217; I&#8217;m told they&#8217;ve an eye
open t&#8217; clap me in once more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; t&#8217; help a poor man take back his own
without troublin&#8217; the judges,&#8221; Bill urged.</p>
<p>The lad hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;ve sore need o&#8217; your limber French
tongue,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;Sure, b&#8217;y, you&#8217;ll go along
with me, will you not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go to law for your own?&#8221;
Archie asked, with a little grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Law!&#8221; Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay burst out. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a
poor show I&#8217;d have in a court at Saint Pierre.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Hut!&#8221; he snorted. &#8220;Law!&ndash;&ndash;for a Newfoundlander
in Saint Pierre!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Archie began.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the help o&#8217; no man&#8217;s money nor
brains nor influence in a business so simple,&#8221;
Bill protested.</p>
<p>The situation was this: Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had
chartered a schooner&ndash;&ndash;his antique schooner&ndash;&ndash;the
schooner that was forever on the point of
sinking with all hands&ndash;&ndash;Bill had chartered the
schooner <i>Heavenly Home</i> to Luke Foremast of
Boney Arm to run a cargo from Saint Pierre. But
no sooner had the schooner appeared in French
waters than she was impounded for a debt that
Luke Foremast unhappily owed Garnot &amp; Cie, of
Saint Pierre. It was a high-handed proceeding,
of course; and it was perhaps undertaken without
scruple because of the unpopularity of all
Newfoundlanders.</p>
<p>Luke Foremast protested in an Anglo-Saxon
roar; but roar and bellow and bark and growl
as he would, it made no difference: the <i>Heavenly
Home</i> was seized, condemned and offered for
sale, as Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had but now learned.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a hard thing to do,&#8221; Archie objected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hut!&#8221; Bill exclaimed. &#8220;&#8217;Tis nothin&#8217; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
goin&#8217; aboard in the dark an&#8217; puttin&#8217; quietly out
t&#8217; sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; Archie laughed, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Armstrong liked to have his son
stand upon his own feet. He did not wish to be
unduly troubled with requests for permission; he
fancied it a babyish habit for a well-grown boy to
fall into. The boy should decide for himself,
said he, where decision was reasonably possible
for him; and if he made mistakes he would
surely pay for them and learn caution and wisdom.
For this reason Archie had no hesitation
in coming to his own decision and immediately
setting out with Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay upon an expedition
which promised a good deal of highly diverting
and wholly unusual experience.</p>
<p>Billy Topsail and Jimmie Grimm wished the
expedition luck when it boarded the mail-boat
that night.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Archie Armstrong did not know until they
were well started that Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay was a
marked man in Saint Pierre. There was no
price on his head, to be sure, but he was answerable
for several offenses which would pass current
in St. John&#8217;s for assault and battery, if not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
for assault with intent to maim or kill (which
Bill had never tried to do)&ndash;&ndash;all committed in
those old days when he was young and wild and
loved a ruction better than a prayer-meeting.</p>
<p>They determined to make a landing by stealth&ndash;&ndash;a
wise precaution, as it appeared to Archie.
So in three days they were at La Maline, a small
fishing harbour on the south coast of Newfoundland,
and a port of call for the Placentia Bay
mail-boat. The Iles Saint Pierre et Miquelon,
the remnant of the western empire of the French,
lay some twenty miles to the southwest, across
a channel which at best is of uncertain mood,
and on this day was as forbidding a waste of
waves and gray clouds as it had been Archie&#8217;s
lot to venture out upon.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had picked up his ideal of a
craft for the passage&ndash;&ndash;a skiff so cheap and rotten
that &#8220;&#8217;twould be small loss, sir, if she sank under
us.&#8221; And the skipper was in a roaring good
humour as with all sail set he drove the old hulk
through that wilderness of crested seas; and big
Josiah Cove, who had been taken along to help
sail the <i>Heavenly Home</i>, as he swung the bail
bucket, was not a whit behind in glowing expectation&ndash;&ndash;in
particular, that expectation which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
concerned an encounter with a gendarme with
whom he had had the misfortune to exchange
nothing but words upon a former occasion.</p>
<p>As for Archie, at times he felt like a smuggler,
and capped himself in fancy with a red turban,
at times like a pirate.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>They made Saint Pierre at dusk&ndash;&ndash;dusk of a
thick night, with the wind blowing half a gale
from the east. They had no mind to subject
themselves to those formalities which might precipitate
embarrassing disclosures; so they ran
up the harbour as inconspicuously as might be,
all the while keeping a covert lookout for the
skinny old craft which they had come to cut out.
The fog, drifting in as they proceeded, added its
shelter to that of the night; and they dared to
make a search.</p>
<p>They found her at last, lying at anchor in the
isolation of government waters&ndash;&ndash;a most advantageous
circumstance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the skiff &#8217;longside, skipper,&#8221; said Josiah.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a bit risky, Josiah, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said Skipper
Bill. &#8220;But &#8217;twould be good&ndash;&ndash;now, really, &#8217;twould&ndash;&ndash;&#8217;twould
be good t&#8217; tread her old deck for a spell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; lay a hand to her wheel,&#8221; said Josiah,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
with a side wink so broad that the darkening
mist could not hide it.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; lay a hand to her wheel,&#8221; repeated the
skipper. &#8220;An&#8217; lay a hand to her wheel!&#8221;</p>
<p>They ran in&ndash;&ndash;full into the lee of her&ndash;&ndash;and
rounded to under the stern. The sails of the
skiff flapped noisily and the water slapped her
sides. They rested breathless&ndash;&ndash;waiting an event
which might warn them to be off into hiding in
the fog. But no disquieting sound came from
the schooner&ndash;&ndash;no startled exclamation, no hail,
no footfall: nothing but the creaking of the
anchor chain and the rattle of the blocks aloft.
A schooner loomed up and shot past like a
shadow; then silence.</p>
<p>Archie gave a low hail in French. There was
no response from the <i>Heavenly Home</i>; nor did
a second hail, in a raised voice, bring forth an
answering sound. It was all silent and dark
aboard. So Skipper Bill reached out with the gaff and
drew the boat up the lee side. He chuckled a
bit and shook himself. It seemed to Archie that
he freed his arms and loosened his great muscles
as for a fight. With a second chuckle he caught
the rail, leaped from the skiff like a cat and
rolled over on the deck of his own schooner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>They heard the thud of his fall&ndash;&ndash;a muttered
word or two, mixed up with laughter&ndash;&ndash;then the
soft fall of his feet departing aft. For a long
time nothing occurred to inform them of what
the skipper was about. They strained their
ears. In the end they heard a muffled cry,
which seemed to come out of the shoreward
cloud of fog&ndash;&ndash;a thud, as though coming from a
great distance&ndash;&ndash;and nothing more.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Archie whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a row aboard a Frenchman t&#8217; win&#8217;ard,
sir,&#8221; said Josiah. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a skipper beatin&#8217; a
&#8217;prentice. They does it a wonderful lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes passed without a sign of the
skipper. Then he came forward on a run. His
feet rang on the deck. There was no concealment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve trussed up the watchman!&#8221; he chortled.</p>
<p>Archie and Josiah clambered aboard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay Finds Himself in Jail and Archie
Armstrong Discovers That Reality is Not as Diverting as
Romance</i></p>
<p>To be sure, Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had overcome
the watchman! He had blundered
upon him in the cabin. Being
observed before he could withdraw, he had
leaped upon this functionary with resistless impetuosity&ndash;&ndash;had
overpowered him, gagged him,
trussed him like a turkey cock and rolled him
into his bunk. The waters roundabout gave no
sign of having been apprised of the capture.
No cry of surprise rang out&ndash;&ndash;no call for help&ndash;&ndash;no
hullabaloo of pursuit. The lights of the old
town twinkled in the foggy night in undisturbed
serenity.</p>
<p>The night was thick, and the wind swept furiously
up from the sea. It would be a dead beat
to windward to make the open&ndash;&ndash;a sharp beat
through a rock-strewn channel in a rising gale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we got her,&#8221; Skipper Bill laughed,
&#8220;what&#8217;ll we do with her?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Archie and Josiah laughed, too: a hearty explosion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can never beat out in this wind,&#8221; said
Bill; &#8220;an&#8217; we couldn&#8217;t handle her if we did&ndash;&ndash;not
in a gale o&#8217; wind like this. All along,&#8221; he chuckled,
&#8220;I been &#8217;lowin&#8217; for a fair wind an&#8217; good
weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>They heard the rattle and creak of oars approaching;
to which, in a few minutes, the voices
of two men added a poignant interest. The
rowers rested on their oars, as though looking
about; then the oars splashed the water again,
and the dory shot towards the <i>Heavenly Home</i>.
Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay and his fellow pirates lay flat
on the deck. The boat hung off the stern of the
schooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hail was in French. It was not answered,
you may be sure, from the <i>Heavenly
Home</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jean!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not aboard,&#8221; spoke up the other man.</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be aboard. His dory&#8217;s tied to the
rail. Jean! Jean Morot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come&ndash;&ndash;let&#8217;s be off to the <i>Voyageur</i>. He&#8217;s
asleep.&#8221; A pair of oars fell in the water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come&ndash;&ndash;take your oars. It&#8217;s too rough to lie
here. And it&#8217;s late enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your oars!&#8221; with an oath.</p>
<p>The Newfoundlanders breathed easier when
they heard the splash and creak and rattle receding;
but they did not rise until the sounds
were out of hearing, presumably in the direction
of the <i>Voyageur</i>.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay began to laugh again.
Archie joined him. But Josiah Cove pointed
out the necessity of doing something&ndash;&ndash;anything&ndash;&ndash;and
doing it quickly. It was all very well to
laugh, said he; and although it might seem a
comical thing to be standing on the deck of a
captured schooner, the comedy would be the
Frenchman&#8217;s if they were caught in the act.
But Archie still chuckled away; the situation was
quite too ridiculous to be taken seriously.
Archie had never been a pirate before; he didn&#8217;t
feel like one now&ndash;&ndash;but he rather liked the feeling
he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stay aboard,&#8221; said he, presently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blest if I want t&#8217; go ashore,&#8221; said Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;We <i>got</i> t&#8217; go ashore,&#8221; Josiah put in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>Before they left the deck of the <i>Heavenly
Home</i> (the watchman having then been made
more comfortable), it was agreed that the
schooner could not make the open sea in the
teeth of the wind. That was obvious; and it
was just as obvious that the Newfoundlander
could not stay aboard. The discovery of the
watchman in the cabin must be chanced until
such a time as a fair wind came in the night.
On their way to the obscure wharf at which they
landed it was determined that Josiah should
board the schooner at nine o&#8217;clock, noon, and six
o&#8217;clock of the next day to feed the captured
watchman and to set the galley fire going for
half an hour to allay suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Skipper Bill,&#8221; said Josiah, seriously,
&#8220;you lie low. If you don&#8217;t you&#8217;re liable to be
took up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take your advice t&#8217; yourself,&#8221; the skipper
retorted. &#8220;Your reputation&#8217;s none o&#8217; the best
in this harbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sail to-morrow night,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given a dark night an&#8217; a fair wind,&#8221; the
skipper qualified.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill made his way to a quiet caf&eacute;
of his acquaintance; and Josiah vanished in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
fog to lie hidden with a shipmate of other days.
Archie&ndash;&ndash;depending upon his youth and air and
accent and well-tailored dress to avert suspicion&ndash;&ndash;went
boldly to the Hotel Joinville and sat
down to dinner. The dinner was good; he
enjoyed it, and was presently delighting in the
romance in which he had a part. It all seemed
too good to be true. How glad he was he had
come! To be here&ndash;&ndash;in the French Islands of
Miquelon&ndash;&ndash;to have captured a schooner&ndash;&ndash;to
have a prisoner in the cabin&ndash;&ndash;to be about to
run off with the <i>Heavenly Home</i>. For the life
of him, Archie could not take the thing seriously.
He chuckled&ndash;&ndash;and chuckled&ndash;&ndash;and chuckled
again.</p>
<p>Presently he walked abroad; and in the
quaint streets and old customs of the little town,
here remote from all the things of the present
and of the new world as we know it in this day,
he found that which soon lifted him into a
dream of times long past and of doughty deeds
for honour and a lady. Soft voices in the streets,
forms flitting from shadow to shadow, priest and
strutting gendarme and veiled lady, gabled
roofs, barred windows, low doorways, the clatter
of sabots, the pendant street lights, the rumble
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of the ten o&#8217;clock drums. These things, seen in
a mist, were all of the days when bold ventures
were made&ndash;&ndash;of those days when a brave man
would recover his own, come what might, if it
had been wrongfully wrested from him. It was
a rare dream&ndash;&ndash;and not broken until he turned
into the Quai de la Ronciere.</p>
<p>As he rounded the corner he was almost
knocked from his feet by a burly fellow in a
Basque cap who was breathless with haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur&ndash;&ndash;if he will pardon&ndash;&ndash;it was not&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
this fellow stammered, apologetically.</p>
<p>Men were hurrying past toward the Caf&eacute;
d&#8217;Espoir, appearing everywhere from the mist
and running with the speed of deep excitement.
There was a clamorous crowd about the door&ndash;&ndash;pushing,
scuffling, shouting.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; Archie asked in
French.</p>
<p>&#8220;An American has killed a gendarme, monsieur.
A ter-rible fellow! Oh, fear-r-rful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why&ndash;&ndash;what&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a ter-rible fellow, monsieur. The
gendarmes have been on the lookout for him
for three years. And when they laid hands on
him he fought, monsieur&ndash;&ndash;fought with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
strength of a savage. It took five gendarmes
to bind him&ndash;&ndash;five, monsieur. Poor Louis Arnot!
He is dead&ndash;&ndash;killed, monsieur, by a pig of an
American with his fist. They are to take the
murderer to the jail. I am just now running
to warn Deschamps to make ready the dungeon
cell. If monsieur will but excuse me, I will&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was off; so Archie joined the crowd at the
door of the caf&eacute;, which was that place to which
Skipper Bill had repaired to hide. He hung on
the outskirts of the crowd, unable to push his
way further. The wrath of these folk was so
noisy that he could catch no word of what went
on within. He devoutly hoped that Skipper Bill
had kept to his hiding-place despite the suspicious
sounds in the caf&eacute;. Then he wormed his way to
the door and entered. A moment later he had
climbed on a barrel and was overlooking the
squirming crowd and eagerly listening to the
clamour. Above every sound&ndash;&ndash;above the cries
and clatter and gabble&ndash;&ndash;rang the fighting English
of Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay.</p>
<p>It was no American; it was Skipper Bill
whom the gendarmes had taken, and he was
now so seriously involved, apparently, that his
worst enemies could wish him no deeper in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
mesh. They had him bound hand and foot and
guarded with drawn swords, fearing, probably,
that somewhere he had a crew of wild fellows at
his back to make a rescue. To attempt a rescue
was not to be thought of. It did not enter the
boy&#8217;s head. He was overcome by grief and
terror. He withdrew into a shadow until they
had carried Skipper Bill out with a crowd yelping
at his heels. Then, white and shaking, he
went to a group in the corner where Louis Arnot,
the gendarme, was stretched out on the floor.</p>
<p>Archie touched the surgeon on the shoulder.
&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; the boy asked, in French, his
voice trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, monsieur; he is alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will he live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure, monsieur!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there any doubt about it?&#8221; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doubt?&#8221; exclaimed the surgeon. &#8220;With
<i>my</i> skill, monsieur? It is impossible&ndash;&ndash;he <i>cannot</i>
die! He will be restored in three days. I&ndash;&ndash;<i>I</i>&ndash;&ndash;I
will accomplish it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221; thought Archie.</p>
<p>The boy went gravely home to bed; and as
he lay down the adventure seemed less romantic
than it had.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Archie Inspects an Opera Bouffe Dungeon Jail, Where
He Makes the Acquaintance of Dust, Dry Rot and Deschamps. In
Which, Also, Skipper Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay Is Advised to Howl Until
His Throat Cracks</i></p>
<p>In the morning Archie went as a tourist to
the jail where Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay was confined.
The wind was blowing fresh from
the west and promised to hold true for the day.
It was a fair, strong wind for the outward bound
craft; but Archie Armstrong had no longer any
interest in the wind or in the <i>Heavenly Home</i>.
He was interested in captives and cells. To his
astonishment he found that the Saint Pierre jail
had been designed chiefly with the idea of impressing
the beholder, and was builded long,
long ago.</p>
<p>It was a low-walled structure situate in a quiet
quarter of the town. The outer walls were exceeding
thick. One might work with a pick
and shovel for a week and never tunnel them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; thought Archie, &#8220;why tunnel them
when it is possible to leap over them?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were jagged on top and strewn with bits
of broken bottle imbedded in the mortar.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; thought Archie, &#8220;why cut one&#8217;s hands
when it is so easy to throw a jacket over the
glass and save the pain?&#8221;</p>
<p>The walls apparently served no good purpose
except to frighten the populace with their
frowns.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>As big Deschamps, the jailer, led Archie
through the musty corridors and cells the boy
perceived that the old building had long ago
gone to wrack. It was a place of rust and dust
and dry rot, of crumbling masonry, of rotted
casements, of rust-eaten bars, of creaking hinges
and broken locks. He had the impression that
a strong man could break in the doors with his
fist and tumble the walls about his ears with a
push.</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, monsieur,&#8221; said Deschamps, at
last. &#8220;Come! I will show you the pig of a
Newfoundlander who half killed a gendarme.
He is a terrible fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had Skipper Bill safe enough&ndash;&ndash;thrown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
into a foul-aired, windowless cell with an iron-bound
door, from which there was no escape.
To release him was impossible, whatever the
condition of the jail in other parts. Archie had
hoped to find a way; but when he saw the cell
in which Skipper Bill was confined he gave up
all idea of a rescue. And at that moment the
skipper came to the narrow grating in the door.
He scowled at the jailer and looked the boy
over blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; exclaimed Deschamps, screwing his
face into a look of disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wait &#8217;til I cotches <i>you!</i>&#8221; the skipper
growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the pig say, monsieur?&#8221; Deschamps
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has not yet repented,&#8221; Archie replied,
evasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; said Deschamps again. &#8220;Come,
monsieur; we shall continue the inspection.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie was taken to the furthermost cell of
the corridor. It was isolated from that part of
the building where the jailer had his living
quarters, and it was a light, roomy place on the
ground floor. The window bars were rusted
thin and the masonry in which they were sunk
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
was falling away. It seemed to Archie that he
himself could wrench the bars away with his
hands; but he found that he could not when he
tried them. He looked out; and what he saw
made him regret that Skipper Bill had not been
confined in that particular cell.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cell, monsieur,&#8221; said Deschamps, importantly,
&#8220;is where I confine the drunken Newfoundland
sailors when&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie looked up with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they make a great noise, monsieur,&#8221;
Deschamps concluded. &#8220;I have the headache,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;So bad and so often I have the
headache, monsieur. I cannot bear the great
noise they make. It is fearful. So I put them
here, and I go to sleep, and they do not trouble
me at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is monsieur in earnest?&#8221; Archie asked.</p>
<p>Deschamps was flattered by this form of address
from a young gentleman. &#8220;It is true,&#8221;
he replied. &#8220;Compelled. That is the word. I
am compelled to confine them here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us return to the Newfoundlander,&#8221; said
Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a pig,&#8221; Deschamps agreed, &#8220;and well
worth looking at.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>When they came to the door of Skipper Bill&#8217;s
cell, Archie was endeavouring to evolve a plan
for having a word with him without exciting
Deschamps&#8217; suspicion. The jailer saved him the
trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;Monsieur is an American,&#8221; said Deschamps.
&#8220;Will he not tell the pig of a Newfoundlander
that he shall have no breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper Bill,&#8221; said Archie, in English,
&#8220;when I leave here you howl until your throat
cracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay nodded. &#8220;How&#8217;s the
wind?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the pig of a Newfoundlander
say?&#8221; Deschamps inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is of no importance,&#8221; Archie replied.</p>
<p>When Archie had inspected the guillotine in
the garret, which Deschamps exhibited to every
visitor with great pride, the jailer led him to the
open air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the prisoners never escape?&#8221; Archie
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Escape!&#8221; Deschamps cried, with reproach
and indignation. &#8220;Monsieur, how could you
suggest it? Escape! From me&ndash;&ndash;from <i>me</i>,
monsieur!&#8221; He struck his breast and extended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
his arms. &#8220;Ah, no&ndash;&ndash;they could not! My
bravery, monsieur&ndash;&ndash;my strength&ndash;&ndash;all the world
knows of them. I am famous, monsieur.
Deschamps, the wrestler! Escape! From <i>me</i>!
Ah, no&ndash;&ndash;it is <i>impossible</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Archie had more closely observed his
gigantic form, his broad, muscular chest, his
mighty arms and thick neck, his large, lowering
face&ndash;&ndash;when he had observed all this he fancied
that a man might as well wrestle with a grizzly
as oppose him, for it would come to the same
thing in the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a strong man,&#8221; Archie admitted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks&ndash;&ndash;thanks&ndash;&ndash;monsieur!&#8221; the delighted
Deschamps responded.</p>
<p>At that moment, a long, dismal howl broke
the quiet. It was repeated even more excruciatingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pig of a Newfoundlander!&#8221; groaned
Deschamps. &#8220;My head! It is fearful. He will
give me the headache.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie departed. He was angry with Deschamps
for having called Newfoundlanders pigs.
After all, he determined, angrily, the jailer was
deserving of small sympathy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Archie Armstrong Goes Deeper In and Thinks He Has
Got Beyond His Depth. Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay Takes Deschamps By the
Throat and the Issue Is Doubtful For a Time</i></p>
<p>That afternoon, after a short conversation
with Josiah Cove, who had thus
far managed to keep out of trouble,
Archie Armstrong spent a brief time on the
<i>Heavenly Home</i> to attend to the health and
comfort of the watchman, who was in no bad
way. Perhaps, after all, Archie thought&ndash;&ndash;if Deschamps&#8217;
headache would only cause the removal
of Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay to the dilapidated cell on
the ground floor&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Heavenly Home</i> might
yet be sailed in triumph to Ruddy Cove. He
strutted the deck, when necessary, with as much
of the insolence of a civic official as he could
command, and no man came near to question
his right. When the watchman&#8217;s friends came
from the <i>Voyageur</i> he drove them away in excellent
French. They went meekly and with
apologies for having disturbed him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So far, well enough,&#8221; thought Archie, as he
rowed ashore, glad to be off the schooner.</p>
<p>It was after dark when, by appointment, the
lad met Josiah. Josiah had provided himself
with a crowbar and a short length of line, which
he said would be sure to come useful, for he had
always found it so. Then the two set off for the
jail together, and there arrived some time after
the drums had warned all good people to be
within doors.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Josiah of a sudden.</p>
<p>It was a hoarse, melancholy croak proceeding
from the other side of the wall. The
skipper&#8217;s cell had been changed, as Archie
had hoped, and the skipper himself was doing
his duty to the bitter end. The street was deserted.
They acted quickly. Josiah gave
Archie a leg. He threw his jacket over the
broken glass and mounted the wall. Josiah
made off at once; it was his duty to have the
skiff in readiness. Archie dropped into the
garden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that you, b&#8217;y?&#8221; whispered Skipper Bill.</p>
<p>Again Archie once more found it impossible
to take the adventure seriously. He began to
laugh. It was far too much like the romances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
he had read to be real. It was play, it seemed&ndash;&ndash;just
like a game of smugglers and pirates,
played on a summer&#8217;s afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it you, Archie?&#8221; the skipper whispered
again.</p>
<p>Archie chuckled aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the wind in the west?&#8221; the skipper asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; Archie replied; &#8220;and blowing a smart
sailing breeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haste, then, lad!&#8221; said the skipper. &#8220;&#8217;Tis
time t&#8217; be off for Ruddy Cove.&#8221;</p>
<p>The window was low. With his crowbar
Archie wrenched a bar from its socket. It came
with a great clatter. It made the boy&#8217;s blood
run cold to hear the noise. He pried the second
and it yielded. Down fell a block of stone
with a crash. While he was feeling for a purchase
on the third bar Skipper Bill caught his
wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist, lad!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a footfall in the corridor. Skipper
Bill slipped into the darkness by the door&ndash;&ndash;vanished
like a shadow. Archie dropped to the
ground. By what unhappy chance had Deschamps
come upon this visitation? Could it
have been the silence of Skipper Bill? Archie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
heard the cover of the grating drawn away from
the peep-hole in the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>That was Deschamps&#8217; voice. Doubtless he
had observed that two bars were missing from
the window. Archie heard the key slipped into
the lock and the door creak on its hinges. All
the time he knew that Skipper Bill was crouched
in the shadow&ndash;&ndash;poised for the spring. The boy
no longer thought of the predicament as a
game. Nor was he inclined to laugh again.
This was the ugly reality once more come to face
him. There would be a fight in the cell. This
he knew. And he waited in terror of the
issue.</p>
<p>There was a quick step&ndash;&ndash;a crash&ndash;&ndash;a quick-drawn
breath&ndash;&ndash;the noise of a shock&ndash;&ndash;a cry&ndash;&ndash;a
groan. Skipper Bill had kicked the door to and
leaped upon the jailer. Archie pried the third
bar out and broke the fourth with a blow. Then
he squirmed through the window. Even in
that dim light&ndash;&ndash;half the night light without&ndash;&ndash;he
could see that the struggle was over. Skipper
Bill had Deschamps by the throat with his great
right hand. He had the jailer&#8217;s waist in his left
arm as in a vise, and was forcing his head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
back&ndash;&ndash;back&ndash;&ndash;back&ndash;&ndash;until Archie thought the Frenchman&#8217;s
spine would crack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kill him!&#8221; Archie cried.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill had no intention of doing so; nor
had Deschamps, the wrestler, any idea of allowing
his back to be broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kill him!&#8221; Archie begged again.</p>
<p>Deschamps was tugging at that right arm of
iron&ndash;&ndash;weakly, vainly tugging to wrench it away
from his throat. His eyes were starting from
their sockets, and his tongue protruded. Back
went the head&ndash;&ndash;back&ndash;&ndash;back! The arm was
pitiless. Back&ndash;&ndash;back! He was fordone. In a
moment his strength departed and he collapsed.
He had not had time to call for help, so quick
had been Bill&#8217;s hand. They bound his limp body
with the length of line Josiah had brought, and
they had no sooner bound him than he revived.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a great man, monsieur,&#8221; he
mumbled. &#8220;You have vanquished me&ndash;&ndash;Deschamps!
You will be famous&ndash;&ndash;famous, monsieur.
I shall send my resignation to His Excellency
the Governor to-morrow. Deschamps&ndash;&ndash;he
is vanquished!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he talkin&#8217; about?&#8221; the skipper
panted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have beaten him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be off, b&#8217;y,&#8221; the skipper gasped.</p>
<p>They locked the door on the inside, clambered
through the window and scaled the wall. They
sped through the deserted streets with all haste.
They came to the landing-place and found the
skiff tugging at her painter with her sails all unfurled.
Presently they were under way for the
<i>Heavenly Home</i>, and, having come safely
aboard, hauled up the mainsail, set the jib and
were about to slip the anchor. Then they heard
the clang, clang, clang of a bell&ndash;&ndash;a warning
clang, clang, clang, which could mean but one
thing: discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fetch up that Frenchman,&#8221; the skipper
roared.</p>
<p>The watchman was loosed and brought on
deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put un in his dory and cast off,&#8221; the skipper
ordered.</p>
<p>This done the anchor was slipped and the sheets
hauled taut. The rest of the canvas was shaken
out and the <i>Heavenly Home</i> gathered way and
fairly flew for the open sea.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>If there was pursuit it did not come within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
sight. The old schooner came safely to Ruddy
Cove, where Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, Josiah Cove and
Archie Armstrong lived for a time in sickening
fear of discovery and arrest. But nothing was
ever heard from Saint Pierre. The <i>Heavenly
Home</i> had been unlawfully seized by the French;
perhaps that is why the Ruddy Cove pirates heard
no more of the Miquelon escapade. There was
hardly good ground in the circumstances for
complaint to the Newfoundland government.
At any rate, Archie wrote a full and true statement
of the adventure to his father in St. John&#8217;s;
and his father replied that his letter had been received
and &#8220;contents noted.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no chiding; and Archie breathed
easier after he had read the letter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which David Grey&#8217;s Friend, the Son of the Factor at Fort
Red Wing, Yarns of the Professor With the Broken Leg, a Stretch
of Rotten River Ice and the Tug of a White Rushing Current</i></p>
<p>One quiet evening, after sunset, in the
early summer, when the folk of Ruddy
Cove were passing time in gossip on
the wharf, while they awaited the coming of the
mail-boat, old David Grey, who had told the tale
of McLeod and the tomahawks, called to Billy
Topsail and his friends. A bronzed, pleasant-appearing
man, David&#8217;s friend, shook hands
with the boys with the grip of a woodsman.
Presently he drifted into a tale of his own boyhood
at Fort Red Wing in the wilderness far
back of Quebec. &#8220;You see,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my
father had never fallen into the habit of coddling
me. So when the lost Hudson Bay Geological
Expedition made Fort Red Wing in the spring&ndash;&ndash;every
man exhausted, except the young professor,
who had broken a leg a month back, and
had set it with his own hands&ndash;&ndash;it was the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
natural thing in the world that my father should
command me to take the news to Little Lake,
whence it might be carried, from post to post,
all the way to the department at Ottawa.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;And send the company doctor up,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;The little professor&#8217;s leg is in a bad way, if I
know anything about doctoring. So you&#8217;ll make
what haste you can.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Keep to the river until you come to the
Great Bend. You can take the trail through the
bush from there to Swift Rapids. If the ice is
broken at the rapids, you&#8217;ll have to go round
the mountain. That&#8217;ll take a good half day
longer. But don&#8217;t be rash at the rapids, and
keep an eye on the ice all along. The sun will
be rotting it by day now. It looks like a break-up
already.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Shall I go alone, sir?&#8217; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said my father, no doubt perceiving the
wish in the question. &#8216;I&#8217;ll have John go with
you for company.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;John was an Indian lad of my own age, or
thereabouts, who had been brought up at the
fort&ndash;&ndash;my companion and friend. I doubt if I
shall ever find a stancher one.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With him at my heels and a little packet of
letters in my breast pocket, I set out early the
next day. It was late in March, and the sun, as
the day advanced, grew uncomfortably hot.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s easy going!&#8217; I cried, when we came
to the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Bad ice!&#8217; John grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it proved to be so&ndash;&ndash;ice which the suns
of clear weather had rotted and the frosts of
night and cold days had not repaired. Rotten
patches alternated with spaces of open water
and of thin ice, which the heavy frost of the
night before had formed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we came near to Great Bend, where
we were to take to the woods, it was late in the
afternoon, and the day was beginning to turn
cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sped on even more cautiously, for in that
place the current is swift, and we knew that the
water was running like mad below us. I was
ahead of John, picking the way; and I found,
to my cost, that the way was unsafe. In a
venture offshore I risked too much. Of a sudden
the ice let me through.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like a fall, feet foremost, and when I
came again to the possession of my faculties,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
with the passing of the shock, I found that my
arms were beating the edge of ice, which
crumbled before them, and that the current was
tugging mightily at my legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look out!&#8217; I gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;The warning was neither heard nor needed.
John was flat on his stomach, worming his way
towards me&ndash;&ndash;wriggling slowly out, his eyes
glistening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meanwhile I had rested my arms on the edge,
which then crumbled no more; but I was helpless
to save myself, for the current had sucked my
legs under the ice, and now held them securely
there, sweeping them from side to side, all the
while tugging as if to wrench me from my hold.
The most I could do was to resist the pull, to grit
my teeth and cling to the advantage I had. It
was for John to make the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was an ominous crack from John&#8217;s
direction. When I turned my eyes to look he
was lying still. Then I saw him wriggle out of
danger, backing away like a crab.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;John!&#8217; I screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The appeal seemed not to move him. He
continued to wriggle from me. When he came to
solid ice he took to his heels. I caught sight of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
him as he climbed the bank, and kept my eyes
upon him until he disappeared over the crest.
He had left me without a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;The water was cold and swift, and the
strength of my arms and back was wearing
out. The current kept tugging, and I realized,
loath as I was to admit it, that half an hour
would find me slipping under the ice. It was
a grave mistake to admit it; for at once fancy
began to paint ugly pictures for me, and the
probabilities, as it presented them, soon flustered
me almost beyond recovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I was chest-high out of the water,&#8217; I told
myself. &#8216;Chest-high! Now my chin is within
four inches of the ice. I&#8217;ve lost three inches.
I&#8217;m lost!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;With that I tried to release my feet from the
clutch of the current, to kick myself back to an
upright position, to lift myself out. It was all
worse than vain. The water was running so
swiftly that it dangled my legs as it willed, and
the rotten ice momentarily threatened to let me
through.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost a full inch of position. So I settled
myself to wait for what might come, determined
to yield nothing through terror or despair. My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
eyes were fixed stupidly upon the bend in the
river, far down, where a spruce-clothed bluff
was melting with the dusk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What with the cold and the drain upon my
physical strength, it may be that my mind was
a blank when relief came. At any rate, it seemed
to have been an infinitely long time in coming;
and it was with a shock that John&#8217;s words restored
me to a vivid consciousness of my situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Catch hold!&#8217; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had crawled near me, although I had not
known of his approach, and he was thrusting
towards me the end of a long pole, which he had
cut in the bush. It was long, but not long
enough. I reached for it, but my hand came
three feet short of grasping it.</p>
<p>&#8220;John grunted and crept nearer. Still it
was beyond me, and he dared venture no farther.
He withdrew the pole; then he crept back and
unfastened his belt. Working deliberately but
swiftly, he bound the belt to the end of the pole,
and came out again. He cast the belt within
reach, as a fisherman casts a line. I caught it,
clutched it, and was hauled from my predicament
by main strength.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;John,&#8217; I said, as we drew near to the half-way
cabin, &#8216;I know your blood, and it&#8217;s all very
well to be careful not to say too much; but there&#8217;s
such a thing as saying too little. Why didn&#8217;t
you tell me where you were going when you
started for that pole?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Huh!&#8217; said John, as if his faithfulness to
me in every fortune were quite beyond suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, I know,&#8217; I insisted, &#8216;but a word or two
would have saved me a deal of uneasiness.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Huh!&#8217; said he.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which a Bearer of Tidings Finds Himself In Peril of His
Life On a Ledge of Ice Above a Roaring Rapid</i></p>
<p>&#8220;We passed that night at the cabin,
where a roaring fire warmed me and
dried my clothes,&#8221; David&#8217;s friend
continued. &#8220;My packet of letters was safe and
dry, so I slept in peace, and we were both as
chirpy as sparrows when we set out the next
morning. It was a clear, still day, with the sun
falling warmly upon us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our way now led through the bush for mile
after mile&ndash;&ndash;little hills and stony ground and
swamp-land. By noon we were wet to the
knees; but this circumstance was then too insignificant
for remark, although later it gave me the
narrowest chance for life that ever came within
my experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made Swift Rapids late in the afternoon,
when the sun was low and a frosty wind was
freezing the pools by the way. The post at Little
Lake lay not more than three miles beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the foot of the rapids, and when the swish and
roar of water first fell upon our ears we hallooed
most joyfully, for it seemed to us that we had
come within reaching distance of our destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said John, when we stood on the shore
of the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I think we can,&#8217; said I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rapids were clear of ice, which had
broken from the quiet water above the verge of
the descent, and now lay heaped up from shore
to shore, where the current subsided at the foot.
The water was most turbulent&ndash;&ndash;swirling, shooting,
foaming over great boulders. It went rushing
between two high cliffs, foaming to the very
feet of them, where not an inch of bank was
showing. At first glance it was no thoroughfare;
but the only alternative was to go round
the mountain, as my father had said, and I had
no fancy to lengthen my journey by four hours,
so I searched the shore carefully for a passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The face of the cliff was such that we could
make our way one hundred yards down-stream.
It was just beyond that point that the difficulty
lay. The rock jutted into the river, and rose
sheer from it; neither foothold nor handhold was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
offered. But beyond, as I knew, it would be easy
enough to clamber along the cliff, which was
shelving and broken, and so, at last, come to the
trail again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s the trouble, John,&#8217; said I, pointing
to the jutting rock. &#8216;If we can get round that,
we can go the rest of the way without any difficulty.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;No go,&#8217; said John. &#8216;Come.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;He jerked his head towards the bush, but I
was not to be easily persuaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;We&#8217;ll go down and look at that place,&#8217; I replied.
&#8216;There may be a way.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a way, a clear, easy way, requiring
no more than a bit of nerve to pass over it,
and I congratulated myself upon persisting to its
discovery. The path was by a stout ledge of
ice, adhering to the cliff and projecting out from
it for about eighteen inches. The river had fallen.
This ledge had been formed when it was at its
highest, and when the water had subsided the ice
had been left sticking to the rock. The ledge
was like the rim of ice that adheres to a tub
when a bucketful of freezing water has been
taken out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I clambered down to it, sounded it, and found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
it solid. Moreover, it seemed to lead all the way
round, broadening and narrowing as it went, but
wide enough in every part. I was sure-footed
and unafraid, so at once I determined to essay
the passage. &#8216;I am going to try it!&#8217; I called to
John, who was clinging to the cliff some yards
behind and above me. &#8216;Don&#8217;t follow until I call
you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Look out!&#8217; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s all right,&#8217; I said, confidently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned my back to the rock and moved out,
stepping sidewise. It was not difficult until I
came to a point where the cliff is overhanging&ndash;&ndash;it
may be a space of twelve feet or less; then I
had to stoop, and the awkward position made
my situation precarious in the extreme, for the
rock seemed all the while bent on thrusting me
off.</p>
<p>&#8220;The river was roaring past. Below me the
water was breaking over a great rock, whence it
shot, swift and strong, against a boulder which
rose above it. I could hear the hiss and swish
and thunder of it; and had I been less confident
in my foothold, I might then and there have been
hopelessly unnerved. There was no mercy in
those seething rapids.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;A fall would be the end of me,&#8217; I thought;
&#8216;but I will not fall.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fall I did, however, and that suddenly, just
after I had rounded the point and was hidden
from John&#8217;s sight. The cold of the late afternoon
had frozen my boots stiff; they had been
soaked in the swamp-lands, and the water was
now all turned to ice.</p>
<p>&#8220;My soles were slippery and my feet were
awkwardly managed. I slipped.</p>
<p>&#8220;My feet shot from under me. A flash of terror
went through me. Then I found myself lying
on my hip, on the edge of the shelf with my legs
dangling over the rapids, my shoulder pressing
the cliff, my hands flat on the ice, and my arms
sustaining nearly the whole weight of my
body.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that instant I heard a thud and a splash,
as of something striking the water, and turning
my eyes, I perceived that a section of the snow
ledge had fallen from the cliff. It was not large,
but it was between John and me, and the space
effectually shut him off from my assistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;My problem was to get to my feet again. But
how? The first effort persuaded me that it was
impossible. My shoulder was against the cliff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
When I attempted to raise myself to a seat on
the ledge I succeeded only in pressing my shoulder
more firmly against the rock. Wriggle as I
would, the wall behind kept me where I was. I
could not gain an inch. I needed no more, for
that would have relieved my arms by throwing
more of my weight upon my hips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in the position of a boy trying to draw
himself to a seat on a window-sill, with the difference
that my heels were of no help to me, for
they were dangling in space. My arms were
fast tiring out. The inch I needed for relief was
past gaining, and it seemed to me then that in a
moment my arms would fail me, and I should
slip off into the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Better go now,&#8217; I thought, &#8216;before my arms
are worn out altogether. I&#8217;ll need them for
swimming.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a glance down the river assured me that
my chance in the rapids would be of the smallest.
Not only was the water swift and turbulent, but
it ran against the barrier of ice at the foot of the
rapids, and it was evident that it would suck me
under, once it got me there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor was there any hope in John&#8217;s presence.
I had told him to stay where he was until I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
called; and, to be sure, in that spot would he
stay. I might call now. But to what purpose?
He could do nothing to help me. He would
come to the gap in the ledge, and from there
peep sympathetically at me. Indeed, he might
reach a pole to me, as he had done on the day
before, but my hands were fully occupied, and I
could not grasp it. So I put John out of my
mind,&ndash;&ndash;for even in the experience of the previous
day I had not yet learned my lesson,&ndash;&ndash;and determined
to follow the only course which lay
open to me, desperate though it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll turn on my stomach,&#8217; I thought, &#8216;and
try to get to my knees on the ledge.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I accomplished the turn, but in the act I so
nearly lost my hold that I lost my head, and
there was a gasping lapse of time before I recovered
my calm.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this change I gained nothing. When I
tried to get to my knees I butted my head
against the overhanging rock, nor could I lift my
foot to the ice and roll over on my side, for the
ledge was far too narrow for that. I had altered
my position, but I had accomplished no change
in my situation. It was impossible for me to
rest more of my weight upon my breast than my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
hips had borne. My weakening arms still had
to sustain it, and the river was going its swirling
way below me, just as it had gone in the beginning.
I had not helped myself at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing for it, I thought, but to
commit myself to the river and make as gallant a
fight for life as I could. So at last I called John,
that he might carry our tidings to their destination
and return to Fort Red Wing with news
of a sadly different kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ho!&#8217; said John.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was staring round the point of rock; and
there he stood, unable to get nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ice under,&#8217; said he, indicating a point below
me. &#8216;More ice. Let down.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What?&#8217; I cried. &#8216;Where?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;More ice. Down there,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Like
this. Let down.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I understood him. Another ledge,
such as that upon which I hung, had been formed
in the same way, and was adhering to the rock
beneath. No doubt there was a pool on the
lower side of the point, and just below me, and
the current would be no obstacle to the formation
of ice. I had looked down from above, and the
upper ledge had hidden the lower from me; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
John, standing by the gap in the upper, could
see it plainly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I had but to let myself down until my
feet rested on the new ledge, and this I did, with
extreme caution and the expenditure of the last
ounce of strength in my arms. Then a glance
assured me that the way was clear to the shelving
cliff beyond.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;You go,&#8217; said John. &#8216;I go round.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;All right,&#8217; said I. &#8216;And, say! I wish I&#8217;d
called you before.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ho!&#8217; said he, as he vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;When John reached the Little Lake post late
that night, the tidings of the safe return of the
Hudson Bay Geological Expedition were on the
way south by another messenger, and the company&#8217;s
physician was moving over the trail
towards Fort Red Wing, making haste to the
aid of the young professor, whom, indeed, he
soon brought back to health. The passage by
the ledge of ice had resulted in a gain of three
hours, but whether or not it saved the professor&#8217;s
life I do not know. I do not think it did. It
nearly cost me mine, but I had no thought of
that when I essayed it, so my experience reflects
no credit upon me whatever. I take fewer rash
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
and reckless chances now on land and water,
and I am not so overreliant upon my own resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learned that a friend&#8217;s help is of
value.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the Ruddy Cove mail-boat
entered the Tickle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Billy Topsail Gets an Idea and, to the Amazement of
Jimmie Grimm, Archie Armstrong Promptly Goes Him One Better</i></p>
<p>While Archie Armstrong was pursuing
his piratical adventure in the French
harbour of St. Pierre, Billy Topsail had
gone fishing with Jimmie Grimm and Donald
North. This was in the trim little sloop that Sir
Archibald had sent north to Billy Topsail in
recognition of his service to Archie during a
great blizzard from which Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had
rescued them both.<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> There were now no fish in
the summer waters of Ruddy Cove; but word
had come down the coast that fish were running
in the north. So up went the sails of the little
<i>Rescue</i>; and with Billy Topsail, Jimmie Grimm
and Bobby North aboard she swept daintily between
the tickle rocks and turned her shapely
prow towards White Bay.</p>
<p>There was good fishing with hook and line;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
and as the hold of the little sloop was small she
was soon loaded with green cod.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low I got an idea,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sail for Ruddy Cove the morrow,&#8221;
Billy went on; &#8220;an&#8217; when we lands our fish we&#8217;ll
go tradin&#8217;. There&#8217;s a deal o&#8217; money in that, I&#8217;m
told; an&#8217; with what we gets for our fish we&#8217;ll
stock the cabin o&#8217; the <i>Rescue</i> and come north
again t&#8217; trade in White Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Donald and Jimmie were silent; the undertaking
was too vast to be comprehended in a
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have Archie,&#8221; said Jimmie, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; poor ol&#8217; Bagg,&#8221; said Donald.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have Archie if he&#8217;ll come,&#8221; Billy agreed,
&#8220;an&#8217; Bagg if we can stow un away.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a long, long silence, during which
the three boys began to dream in an amazing way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; Donald North asked, at last, &#8220;what
you goin&#8217; t&#8217; do with your part o&#8217; the money we&#8217;ll
make at tradin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a quiet evening on the coast; and from
the deck of the sloop, where she lay in harbour,
the boys looked away to a glowing sunset, above
the inland hills and wilderness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Billy replied. &#8220;What you
goin&#8217; t&#8217; do with your share, Jimmie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Jimmie, seriously. &#8220;What
you goin&#8217; t&#8217; do with yours, Donald?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t quite made up my mind,&#8221; said Donald,
with an anxious frown. &#8220;I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll wait an&#8217; see
what Archie does with his.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three boys stowed away in the little
cabin of the <i>Rescue</i> very early that night. They
were to set sail for Ruddy Cove at dawn of the
next morning.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Archie Armstrong, now returned from the
Miquelon Islands and relieved of his anxiety
concerning that adventure by his father&#8217;s letter,
was heart and soul for trading. But he scorned
the little <i>Rescue</i>. It was merely that she was
too small, he was quick to add; she was trim
and fast and stout, she possessed every virtue a
little craft could have, but as for trading, on any
scale that half-grown boys could tolerate, she
was far too small. If a small venture could
succeed, why shouldn&#8217;t a larger one? What
Archie wanted&ndash;&ndash;what he determined they should
have&ndash;&ndash;was a thirty-ton schooner. Nothing less
would do. They must have a thirty-ton fore-an&#8217;-after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
with Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay to skipper her.
The <i>Heavenly Home</i>? Not at all! At any rate,
Josiah Cove was to take that old basket to the
Labrador for the last cruise of the season.</p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm laughed at Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you laughing at?&#8221; Archie demanded,
with a grin.</p>
<p>Jimmie couldn&#8217;t quite tell; but the truth was
that the fisherman&#8217;s lad could never get used to
the airy, confident, masterful way of a rich man&#8217;s
son and a city-bred boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look you, Archie!&#8221; said Billy Topsail,
&#8220;where in time is you goin&#8217; t&#8217; get that schooner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>On Time</i>,&#8221; was the prompt reply. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
call her the <i>Spot Cash</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy realized that the <i>On Time</i> might be had.
Also that she might be called the <i>Spot Cash</i>.
She had lain idle in the harbour since her skipper
had gone off to the mines at Sidney to make
more money in wages than he could take from
the sea. But how charter her?</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you goin&#8217; t&#8217; get the stock?&#8221; Jimmie
Grimm inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know whether I can or not,&#8221; said
Archie; &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to try my level best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie Armstrong left for St. John&#8217;s by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
next mail-boat. He was not the lad to hesitate.
What his errand was the Ruddy Cove boys
knew well enough; but concerning the prospect
of success, they could only surmise. However,
Archie wouldn&#8217;t be long. Archie wasn&#8217;t the lad
to be long about anything. What he undertook
to do he went right <i>at</i>!</p>
<p>&#8220;If he can only do it,&#8221; Billy Topsail said.</p>
<p>Jimmie Grimm and Donald North and Bagg
stared at Billy Topsail like a litter of eager and
expectant little puppies. And Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay
stood like a wise old dog behind. If only Archie
could!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Sir Archibald Armstrong Is Almost Floored By a
Business Proposition, But Presently Revives, and Seems to be
About to Rise to the Occasion</i></p>
<p>Sir Archibald Armstrong was a
colonial knight. His decoration&ndash;&ndash;one of
Her late Majesty&#8217;s birthday honours&ndash;&ndash;had
come to him for beneficent political services to the
colony in time of trouble and ruin. He was a Newfoundlander
born and bred (though educated in
the English schools); and he was fond of saying in
a pleasantly boastful way and with a little twinkle
of amusement in his sympathetic blue eyes: &#8220;I&#8217;m
a fish-merchant, sir&ndash;&ndash;a Newfoundland fish-merchant!&#8221;
This was quite true, of course; but it
was only half the truth. Directly or indirectly,
Sir Archibald&#8217;s business interests touched every
port in Newfoundland, every harbour of the
Labrador, the markets of Spain and Portugal, of
the West Indies and the South American Republics.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald was alone in his cozy office.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
The day was raw and wet. There was a blazing
fire in the grate&ndash;&ndash;an agreeable bit of warmth and
brightness to contrast with the rain beating on
the window-panes.</p>
<p>A pale little clerk put his head in at the door.
&#8220;Beg pardon, sir,&#8221; he jerked. &#8220;Master Archie,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master Archie!&#8221; Sir Archibald exclaimed.</p>
<p>Archie entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; said Sir Archibald, in amazement.
&#8220;Back from Ruddy Cove?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On business,&#8221; Archie replied.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald laughed pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make fun of me, father,&#8221; said Archie.
&#8220;I&#8217;m in dead earnest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much is it, son?&#8221; This was an ancient
joke between the two. Both laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d be surprised if you knew,&#8221; the boy returned.
&#8220;But look here, father! please don&#8217;t
take it in that way. I&#8217;m really in earnest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s money, son,&#8221; Sir Archibald insisted. &#8220;I
know it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Archie, with a grave frown; &#8220;it
<i>is</i> money. It&#8217;s a good deal of money. It&#8217;s so
much money, dad, that you&#8217;ll sit up when you
hear about it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>Sir Archibald looked sharply into his son&#8217;s
grave eyes. &#8220;Ahem!&#8221; he coughed. &#8220;Money,&#8221;
he mused, &#8220;and a good deal of it. What&#8217;s the
trouble, son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble, father,&#8221; said Archie; &#8220;just a
ripping good chance for fun and profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald moved to the chair behind a
broad flat-top desk by the window. This was
the queer little throne from which all business
problems were viewed. It was from the shabby
old chair&ndash;&ndash;with a broad window behind&ndash;&ndash;that
all business judgments were delivered. Did an
outport merchant want credit in any large way,
it was from the opposite chair&ndash;&ndash;with the light
falling full in his face through the broad window&ndash;&ndash;that
he put the case to Sir Archibald. Archie
sat down in that chair and leaned over the desk.
Sir Archibald stretched his legs, put his hands
deep in his pockets, let his chin fall on his breast
and stared searchingly into his son&#8217;s face. The
rain was driven noisily against the windows; the
fire crackled and glowed. As between the two
at the desk there was a momentary silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Sir Archibald, shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go trading,&#8221; Archie replied.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald lifted his eyebrows&ndash;&ndash;then pursed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
his lips. The matter of credit was evidently to
be proposed to him. It was to be put, too, it
seemed, in a business way. Very well: Sir
Archibald would deal with the question in a
business way. He felt a little thrill of pleasure&ndash;&ndash;he
was quite conscious of it. It was delightful
to have his only son in a business discussion, at
the familiar old desk, with the fire glowing, the
wind rattling the windows and the rain lashing
the panes. Sir Archibald was a business man;
and now he realized for the first time that Archie
was grown to a companionable age. This, after
all, he reflected, was what he had been working
for: To engage in business with his own son.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you want credit?&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, dad!&#8221; Archie burst out; &#8220;of
course, I want credit. I&#8217;ll tell you all about it,&#8221;
he rattled anxiously. &#8220;We want&ndash;&ndash;we means
Billy Topsail, Jimmie Grimm, Donald North
and me&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;re all Ruddy Cove fellows, you
know&ndash;&ndash;we want to charter the <i>On Time</i> at
Ruddy Cove, call her the <i>Spot Cash</i>, stock her
cabin and hold&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s only a twenty-tonner&ndash;&ndash;and
ship Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay for skipper and trade
the ports of White Bay and the French Shore.
All the boys&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My traders,&#8221; Sir Archibald interrupted,
quietly, &#8220;are trading White Bay and the French
Shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it, dad,&#8221; Archie began eagerly,
&#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you compete with them?&#8221; Sir Archibald
asked, his eyes wide open. &#8220;The <i>Black Eagle</i>
sails north on a trading voyage in a fortnight.
She&#8217;s loading now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Archie, blithely.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Encounter harsh competition,&#8221; Sir Archibald
put in, dryly. &#8220;How will you go about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie had been fidgeting in his chair&ndash;&ndash;hardly
able to command his politeness.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cash trader!&#8221; he burst out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Sir Archibald drawled, enlightened.
&#8220;I see. I see-ee!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be the only cash trader on the coast,
dad,&#8221; Archie continued; &#8220;and we&#8217;ll advertise&ndash;&ndash;and
carry a phonograph&ndash;&ndash;and sell under the
credit prices&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald whistled in chagrin.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll make good,&#8221; Archie concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little pirate!&#8221; Sir Archibald ejaculated.</p>
<p>Father and son laughed together. Then Sir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
Archibald began to drum on the desk with his
finger-tips. Presently he got up and began to
pace the floor, his hands thrust deep in his
pockets, his lips pursed, his brows drawn in a
scowl of reflection. This was a characteristic
thing. Sir Archibald invariably paced, and
pursed his lips, and scowled, when a problem of
more than ordinary interest engaged him. He
knew that Archie&#8217;s plan was not unreasonable.
There <i>might</i>&ndash;&ndash;there <i>ought</i> to be&ndash;&ndash;good profit in
a cash-trading voyage in a small schooner to
the harbours of White Bay and the French Shore.
There are no shops in most of these little settlements.
Shops go to the people in the form of
trading-schooners from St. John&#8217;s and the larger
ports of the more southerly coast. It is in this
way that the fisher-folk procure their flour and
tea, their medicines and clothing, their tackle,
their molasses, pins and needles, their trinkets,
everything, in fact, both the luxuries and necessities
of life. It is chiefly a credit business, the
prices based on credit; the folk are outfitted in
the spring and pay in salt-cod in the late summer
and fall. Why shouldn&#8217;t a cash-trader, underselling
the credit plan, do well on the coast in
a small way?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>By and by, his face clearing, Sir Archibald sat
down at the desk again.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you want?&#8221; he asked,
directly.</p>
<p>Archie took a grip on the arms of his chair
and clenched his teeth. It took a good deal of
resolution to utter the amount.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well?&#8221; Sir Archibald impatiently demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars,&#8221; said Archie, grimly.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald started.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred and fifty dollars in cash,&#8221;
Archie added, &#8220;and seven hundred and fifty in
credit at the warehouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the security?&#8221; Sir Archibald blandly
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security!&#8221; Archie gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a customary consideration in business,&#8221;
said Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>Archie&#8217;s house of cards seemed to be tumbling
about his ears. Security? He had not thought
of that. He began to drum on the desk with his
finger-tips. Presently he got up and began to
pace the floor, his hands thrust deep in his
pockets, his lips pursed, his brow drawn in a
scowl of reflection. Sir Archibald, recognizing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
his own habit in his son&#8217;s perturbation, smiled in
a fatherly-fond way. The boy was very dear to
him; no doubt about it. But Sir Archibald was
not sentimental in the affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; said Archie, by and by, his face
clearing as he sat down, &#8220;I could offer you security,
and good enough security, but it doesn&#8217;t
seem quite fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald asked the nature of the bond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a pony and cart, a motor boat and a
sloop yacht,&#8221; Archie replied, grinning. &#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221;
he drawled, with a sly drooping of his eyelids,
&#8220;that they&#8217;re worth more than a thousand dollars.
Eh, father? What do <i>you</i> think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald guffawed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; Archie went on, seriously,
&#8220;that you gave them to me; and it doesn&#8217;t seem
fair to you to offer them as security. But I tell
you, dad,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;if we don&#8217;t make good
in this trading cruise I&#8217;ll sell those things and do
without &#8217;em. It isn&#8217;t fair, I know&ndash;&ndash;it seems
pretty mean to you&ndash;&ndash;it looks as if I didn&#8217;t care
for what you&#8217;ve given me. But I do care; and
you know I care. The trouble is that I want
awfully to go trading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the only security you have?&#8221;

<p>&#8220;Except mother,&#8221; said Archie. &#8220;But,&#8221; he
added, hastily, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I <i>won&#8217;t</i>&ndash;&ndash;drag a
lady into this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald threw back his head and roared.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you laughing at, dad?&#8221; Archie asked,
a little offended, if a quick flush meant anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; his father replied, &#8220;that the lady
wouldn&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Archie, grave with his little problem
of honour; &#8220;but I wouldn&#8217;t let a lady in for
a thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Son,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, now all at once
turning very serious, &#8220;you have better security
than your pony and sloop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie looked up in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is your integrity,&#8221; Sir Archibald explained,
gently, &#8220;and your efficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie flushed with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are great things to possess,&#8221; said Sir
Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Archie, rising in acknowledgment
of this hearty compliment.</p>
<p>The lad was genuinely moved.</p>

</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the Honour of Archie Armstrong Becomes
Involved, the First of September Becomes a Date of Utmost
Importance, He Collides With Tom Tulk, and a Note is Made in the
Book of the Future</i></p>
<p>Sir Archibald began again to tap the
desk with his finger-tips. Archie strayed
to the broad window and looked out upon
the wharves and harbour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the <i>Black Eagle</i> at the wharf?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Black Eagle</i>, sure enough!&#8221; Sir Archibald
laughed. &#8220;She&#8217;s the White Bay and
French Shore trader.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trade enough for all,&#8221; Archie returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;George Rumm, master,&#8221; said Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still?&#8221; Archie exclaimed.</p>
<p>The sailing reputation of Skipper George had
been in question through the season. He had
come within six inches of losing the <i>Black Eagle</i>
in a small gale of the last voyage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s clerk?&#8221; Archie asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tommy Bull, boy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>No friend of Archie!</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharp enough, anyhow,&#8221; the boy thought.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald put his hands in his pockets
again and began to pace the floor; his lips were
pursed, his brows drawn. Archie waited anxiously
at the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;When,&#8221; demanded Sir Archibald, pausing
abruptly in his walk&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;when do you propose to
liquidate this debt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sail the <i>Spot Cash</i> into St. John&#8217;s harbour,
sir, on September first, or before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With three hundred quintals of fish in her
hold, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Three hundred quintals of dry fish, at four
dollars, roughly, a quintal, was twelve hundred
dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than that, sir,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, boy,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, briskly, &#8220;the
security I have spoken of is all right, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not worth much at auction sale,&#8221; Archie
interrupted, grinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no better security in the world,&#8221; said
Sir Archibald, &#8220;than youth, integrity and capacity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll back you,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, shortly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; Archie declared, his eyes shining
with a little mist of delight and affection, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
stand by this thing for all I&#8217;m worth!&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands upon it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Sir Archibald presently wrote a check and
scribbled a few lines on a slip of paper. The
check was for two hundred and fifty dollars; it
was for running expenses and emergencies that
Archie needed the hard cash. The slip of paper
was an order upon the warehouses and shops
for credit in the sum of seven hundred and fifty
dollars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, &#8220;it is explicitly
understood between us that on or before the first
of September you are to turn over to the firm of
Armstrong &amp; Company a sufficient quantity of
properly cured fish to liquidate this account.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Archie replied, earnestly; &#8220;on or
before the first day of September next.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You perfectly understand the terms?&#8221; Sir
Archibald insisted. &#8220;You know the nature of
this obligation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, son,&#8221; said Sir Archibald; &#8220;your
honour is involved.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>Archie received the two slips of paper. It
must be confessed that they burned his fingers a
little. It was a good deal to come into possession
of all at once&ndash;&ndash;a good deal of money and
an awe-inspiring responsibility. Sir Archibald
watched the boy&#8217;s face narrowly. He seemed
to be pleased with what he found there&ndash;&ndash;a little
fear, a little anxiety, a great deal of determination.
The veteran business man wondered if
the boy would sleep as easily as usual that night.
Would he wake up fresh and smiling in the
morning? These were large cares to lie upon
the shoulders of a lad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I give you a&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;a receipt&ndash;&ndash;or a
note&ndash;&ndash;or anything like that?&#8221; Archie asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are upon your honour,&#8221; said his father.</p>
<p>Archie scratched his head in doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your honour,&#8221; Sir Archibald repeated,
smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first of September,&#8221; Archie laughed.
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget that date.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end he had good cause to remember it.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Before Archie left the office Sir Archibald led
him to the broad window behind the desk.
Archie was used to this. It was his father&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
habit. The thing was not done in a spirit of
boasting, as the boy was very well aware. Nor
was it an attempt to impress the boy with a sense
of his own importance and future wealth in the
world. It was rather a well-considered and consistent
effort to give him a sense of the reality
and gravity of the obligations that would some
day be his. From the broad window Archie
looked out once more upon the various activities
of his father&#8217;s great business. There were
schooners fitting out for the fishing cruise to the
Labrador; there were traders taking in stores
for the voyage to the Straits of Belle Isle, to the
South Coast, to the French Shore; there were
fore-and-afters outbound to the Grand Banks and
waiting for a favourable wind; there were coastwise
vessels, loading flour and pork for the outport
merchants; there were barques awaiting
more favourable weather in which to load salt-cod
for the West Indies and Spain.</p>
<p>All this never failed to oppress Archie a little
as viewed from the broad window of his father&#8217;s
office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Sir Archibald, moving a hand
to include the shipping and storehouses.</p>
<p>Archie gazed into the rainy day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see?&#8221; his father asked, in a
way half bantering, half grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your ships and wharves, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, &#8220;they will be
yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t say that, dad&ndash;&ndash;at least,
not just in that way,&#8221; said Archie, turning away
from the window. &#8220;It sort of frightens me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald laughed and clapped him on the
back. &#8220;You know what I mean,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that the firm has a name,&#8221; said
Archie. &#8220;You mean that the name must never
be disgraced. I know what you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope,&#8221; said Archie, the suspicion of a
quaver in his voice and a tremble in his lower
lip, &#8220;that I&#8217;ll never disgrace it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor the name of the little firm that goes into
business this day,&#8221; said Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>Archie&#8217;s solemn face broke into a smile of
amusement and surprise. &#8220;Why, dad,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;it hasn&#8217;t got a name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Armstrong &amp; Company, Junior?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Armstrong, Topsail, Grimm &amp; Company,&#8221;
said Archie, promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck to it!&#8221; wished Sir Archibald.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s not it at all,&#8221; said Archie. &#8220;Billy
Topsail schemed this thing out. Wish luck to
the firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Build the firm,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, &#8220;upon
hard work and fair play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie hurriedly said they would&ndash;&ndash;and vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Son is growing up,&#8221; thought Sir Archibald,
when the boy had gone. &#8220;Son is decidedly
growing up. Well, well!&#8221; he sighed; &#8220;son is
growing up and in far more trouble than he
dreams of. It&#8217;s a big investment, too. However,&#8221;
he thought, well pleased and cheerful
again, &#8220;let him go ahead and learn his daddy&#8217;s
business. And I&#8217;ll back him,&#8221; he declared, speaking
aloud in his enthusiastic faith. &#8220;By Jove!
I&#8217;ll back him to win!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At the foot of the stairway Archie collided full
tilt with two men who were engaged in intimate
conversation as they passed the door. The one
was George Rumm, skipper of the <i>Black Eagle</i>&ndash;&ndash;a
timid, weak-mouthed, shifty-eyed man, with
an obsequious drawl in his voice, a diffident manner,
and, altogether, a loose, weak way. The
other was old Tom Tulk of Twillingate. Archie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
leaped back with an apology to Skipper George.
The boy had no word to say to Tom Tulk of
Twillingate. Tom Tulk was notoriously a rascal
whom the law was eager to catch but could never
quite satisfactorily lay hands on. It did not occur
to Archie that no wise skipper would put
heads mysteriously together in a public place
with old Tom Tulk of Twillingate. The boy was
too full of his own concerns to take note of
anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Skipper George!&#8221; he cried, buoyantly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you on the French Shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; north?&#8221; Skipper George drawled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tradin&#8217;,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>Skipper George started. Tom Tulk scowled.
&#8220;Goin&#8217; aboard the <i>Black Eagle</i>?&#8221; asked Skipper
George.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tradin&#8217; on my own hook, Skipper George,&#8221;
said Archie; &#8220;and I&#8217;m bound to cut your throat
on the Shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Tulk and Skipper George exchanged
glances as Archie darted away. There was
something of relief in Skipper George&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;a
relieved and teasing little smile. But Tom
Tulk was frankly angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little shaver!&#8221; said he, in disgust.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>It was written in the book of the future that
Skipper George Rumm and Archie Armstrong
should fall in with each other on the north coast
before the summer was over.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Notorious Tom Tulk o&#8217; Twillingate and the Skipper of
the &#8220;Black Eagle&#8221; Put Their Heads Together Over a Glass of Rum
in the Cabin of a French Shore Trader</i></p>
<p>There was never a more notorious
rascal in Newfoundland than old Tom
Tulk of Twillingate. There was never
a cleverer rascal&ndash;&ndash;never a man who could devise
new villainies as fast and execute them as neatly.
The law had never laid hands on him. At any
rate not for a crime of importance. He had
been clapped in jail once, but merely for debt;
and he had carried this off with flying colours
by pushing past the startled usher in church and
squatting his great flabby bulk in the governor&#8217;s
pew of the next Sunday morning. He was a
thief, a chronic bankrupt, a counterfeiter, an
illicit liquor seller. It was all perfectly well
known; but not once had a constable brought
an offense home to him. He had once been
arrested for theft, it is true, and taken to St.
John&#8217;s by the constables; but on the way he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
had stolen a watch from one and put it in the
pocket of the other, thereby involving both in
far more trouble than they could subsequently
involve him.</p>
<p>Add to these evil propensities a deformed
body and a crimson countenance and you have
the shadow of an idea of old Tom Tulk.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>George Rumm and Tom Tulk boarded the
<i>Black Eagle</i> in the rain and sought the shelter
of her little cabin. The cook had made a fire
for the skipper; the cabin was warm and quiet.
Tom Tulk closed the door with caution and
glanced up to see that the skylights were
tight. Skipper George produced the bottle and
glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Skipper George,&#8221; said Tom Tulk, as
he tipped the bottle, &#8220;&#8217;tis a mint o&#8217; money an&#8217;
fair easy t&#8217; make.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likin&#8217; the job,&#8221; the skipper complained.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not likin&#8217; the job at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis an easy one,&#8221; Tom Tulk maintained,
&#8220;an&#8217; &#8217;tis well paid when &#8217;tis done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper George scowled in objection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ve a soft heart for man&#8217;s work,&#8221; said
Tom, with a bit of a sneer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>Skipper George laughed. &#8220;Is you thinkin&#8217; t&#8217;
drive me by makin&#8217; fun o&#8217; me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; nothin&#8217;,&#8221; Tom Tulk replied,
&#8220;but t&#8217; show you how it can be done. Will you
listen t&#8217; me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me!&#8221; George Rumm declared.</p>
<p>Tom Tulk observed, however, that the skipper&#8217;s
ears were wide open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not me!&#8221; Skipper George repeated, with a
loud thump on the table. &#8220;No, sir! I&#8217;ll have
nothin&#8217; t&#8217; do with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom Tulk fancied that the skipper&#8217;s ears were
a little bit wider than before; he was not at all
deceived by this show of righteousness on the
part of a weak man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;Say no more
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not denyin&#8217;,&#8221; said Skipper George, &#8220;that
it <i>could</i> be done. I&#8217;m not denyin&#8217; that it would
be easy work. But I tells you, Tom Tulk, that
I&#8217;ll have nothin&#8217; t&#8217; do with it. I&#8217;m an honest
man, Tom Tulk, an&#8217; I&#8217;d thank you t&#8217; remember it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; Tom Tulk sighed again.
&#8220;There&#8217;s many a man in this harbour would
jump at the chance; but there&#8217;s never another
so honest that I could trust him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Many a man, if you like,&#8221; Skipper George
growled; &#8220;but not me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; Tom Tulk agreed, with a covert
little sneer and grin; &#8220;not you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a prison offense, man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re cotched,&#8221; Tom Tulk laughed.
&#8220;An&#8217; tell me, George Rumm, is <i>I</i> ever been
cotched?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sayin&#8217; you is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; nor never will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had all been talked over before, of course;
and it would be talked over again before a fortnight
was past and the <i>Black Eagle</i> had set sail
for the French Shore with a valuable cargo.
Tom Tulk had begun gingerly; he had proceeded
with exquisite caution; he had ventured
a bit more; at last he had come boldly out with
the plan. Manned with care&ndash;&ndash;manned as she
could be and as Tom Tulk would take care to
have her&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Black Eagle</i> was the ship for the
purpose; and Skipper George, with a reputation
for bad seamanship, was the man for the
purpose. And the thing <i>would</i> be easy. Tom
Tulk knew it. Skipper George knew it. It
could be successfully done. There was no
doubt about it; and Skipper George hated to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
think that there was no doubt about it. The
ease and safety with which he might have the
money tumble into his pocket troubled him. It
was not so much a temptation as an aggravation.
He found himself thinking about it too
often; he wanted to put it out of his mind, but
could not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Tom Tulk,&#8221; said he, at last, flushing
angrily, &#8220;let&#8217;s have no more o&#8217; this. I&#8217;m fair
tired of it. I&#8217;ll have nothin&#8217; t&#8217; do with it; an&#8217; I
tells you so, once an&#8217; for all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass the bottle,&#8221; said Tom Tulk.</p>
<p>The bottle went from hand to hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll say no more about it,&#8221; said Tom Tulk;
&#8220;but I tells you, Skipper George, that that little
clerk o&#8217; yours, Tommy Bull, is just the ticket.
As for a crew, I got un handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Belay, belay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, ay, Skipper George,&#8221; Tom Tulk agreed;
&#8220;but as for fetchin&#8217; a cargo o&#8217; fish into St. John&#8217;s
harbour without tellin&#8217; where it came from, if
there&#8217;s any man can beat me at that, why,
I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper George got up and pulled open the
hatch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again,&#8221; said Tom Tulk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>Skipper George of the <i>Black Eagle</i> helped
himself to another dram when Tom Tulk had
withdrawn his great body and sly face. It was
true, all that Tom Tulk had said. It was true
about the clerk; he was ripe to go bad. It was
true about the crew; with hands scarce, and
able-bodied young fellows bound to the Sidney
mines for better wages, Skipper George could
ship whom he liked and Tom Tulk chose. It
was true about fetching fish into St. John&#8217;s without
accounting whence it came. Tom Tulk
could do it; nobody would ask eccentric old
Tom Tulk where he got his fish&ndash;&ndash;everybody
would laugh. It was true about the skipper himself;
it was quite true that his reputation was
none of the best as a sailing-master. But he had
never lost a ship yet. They might say he had
come near it, if they liked; but he had never
lost a ship yet. No, sir; he had never lost a
ship yet. Nor would he. He&#8217;d fetch the <i>Black
Eagle</i> home, right enough, and <i>show</i> Sir Archibald
Armstrong!</p>
<p>But the thing would be easy. It was disgustingly
easy in prospect. Skipper George
wished that old Tom Tulk had never come near
to bother him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hang Tom Tulk!&#8221; thought he.</p>
<p>But how easy, after all, the thing would be!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The first hand put his head in the hatchway to
tell Skipper George that he was to report to Sir
Archibald Armstrong in the office at once.
Skipper George was not quite easy about the
three drams he had taken; but there was nothing
for it but to appear in the office without
delay. As a matter of fact Sir Archibald Armstrong
detected nothing out of the way. He had
something to say to Skipper George about the
way to sail a schooner&ndash;&ndash;about timid sailing, and
reckless sailing, and feeling about in fogs, and
putting out to sea, and running for harbour.
When he had finished&ndash;&ndash;and he spoke long and
earnestly, with his blue eyes flashing, his head
in the air, his teeth snapping once in a while&ndash;&ndash;when
Sir Archibald had finished, Skipper George
was standing with his cap in his hand, his face
flushed, answering, &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; and, &#8220;No, sir,&#8221;
in a way of the meekest. When he left the office
he was unpleasantly aware that he was face to
face with his last chance. In this new trouble he
forgot all about Tom Tulk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper George,&#8221; he thought, taking counsel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
with himself, as he poured another dram, &#8220;you
got t&#8217; do better.&#8221;</p>
<p>He mused a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> do better,&#8221; he determined. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show
un that I can sail a schooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he stowed away for the night, a little
resentment crept into his thoughts of Sir Archibald.
He had never felt this way before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got t&#8217; stop this,&#8221; he thought.</p>
<p>Tom Tulk was then dreaming over a glass of
rum; and his dreams were pleasant dreams&ndash;&ndash;concerning
Skipper George of the <i>Black Eagle</i>.</p>

to Kids, Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay is Persuaded to Tussle With &#8220;The
Lost Pirate,&#8221; and the &#8220;Spot Cash&#8221; Sets Sail</i></p>
<p>For three dismal, foggy days, Archie Armstrong
was the busiest business man in St.
John&#8217;s, Newfoundland. He was forever
damp, splashed with mud, grimy-faced, wilted as
to clothes and haggard as to manner. But make
haste he must; there was not a day&ndash;&ndash;not an hour&ndash;&ndash;to
spare: for it was now appallingly near
August; and the first of September would delay
for no man. When, with the advice of Sir
Archibald and the help of every man-jack in
the warehouses (even of the rat-eyed little
Tommy Bull), the credit of Topsail, Armstrong,
Grimm &amp; Company had been exhausted to the
last penny, Archie sighed in a thoroughly self-satisfied
way, pulled out his new check-book and
plunged into work of another sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that bank-account holding out?&#8221; Sir
Archibald asked, that evening.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little bit bent, dad,&#8221; Archie replied,
&#8220;but not yet broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald looked concerned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Advertising,&#8221; Archie briefly explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, in protest, &#8220;nobody
has ever advertised in White Bay before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody is just about to,&#8221; Archie laughed.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald was puzzled. &#8220;Wh-wh-what
<i>for</i>?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;What kind of advertising?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Handbills, dad, and concerts, and flags, and
circus-lemonade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing more, son?&#8221; Sir Archibald mocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Se&ntilde;or Fakerino,&#8221; Archie replied, with a
smack of self-satisfaction, &#8220;the World&#8217;s Greatest
Magician.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The same being?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours respectfully, A. Armstrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald shrugged his shoulders. Then
his eyes twinkled, his sides began to shake, and
he threw back his head and burst into a roar of
laughter, in which Archie and his mother&ndash;&ndash;they
were all at dinner&ndash;&ndash;joined him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, dad,&#8221; Archie exclaimed, with vast enthusiasm,
&#8220;the firm of Topsail, Armstrong,
Grimm &amp; Company is going to give the people
of White Bay such a good time this summer that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
they&#8217;ll never deal with anybody else. And we&#8217;re
going to give them the worth of their money, too&ndash;&ndash;every
penny&#8217;s worth. On a cash basis we can
afford to. We&#8217;re going into business to build up a
business; and when I come back from that English
school next summer it&#8217;s going to go right ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald admitted the good prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity the poor <i>Black Eagle</i>!&#8221; said Archie,
grinning.</p>
<p>Lady Armstrong finished Se&ntilde;or Fakerino&#8217;s
gorgeously spangled crimson robe and high-peaked
hat that night and Archie completed a
very masterpiece of white beard. Afterwards,
Archie packed his trunks. When he turned in at
last, outward bound next day by the cross-country
mixed train, he had the satisfaction of knowing that
he had stowed the phonograph, the printing-press
and type, the signal flags, the magical apparatus
and Fakerino costume and the new accordion; and
he knew&ndash;&ndash;for he had taken pains to find out&ndash;&ndash;that
the stock of trading goods, which he had bought
with most anxious discrimination, was packed and
directed and waiting at the station, consigned to
Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company, General
Merchants, Ruddy Cove, Newfoundland.</p>
<p>Archie slept well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>When the mail-boat made Ruddy Cove,
Archie was landed, in overflowing spirits, with
his boxes and bales and barrels and trunks and
news. The following days were filled with intense
activity. Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp;
Company chartered the <i>On Time</i> in due form;
and with the observance of every legal requirement
she was given a new name, the <i>Spot Cash</i>.
They swept and swabbed her, fore and aft; they
gave her a line or two of gay paint; they fitted
her cabin with shelves and a counter and her
forecastle with additional bunks; and Bill o&#8217;
Burnt Bay went over her rigging and spars.
While Jimmie Grimm, Bobby North and Bagg
unpacked the stock and furnished the cabin
shelves and stowed the hold, Billy Topsail and
Archie turned to on the advertising.</p>
<p>The printing-press was set up in Mrs. Skipper
William&#8217;s fish-stage. Billy Topsail&ndash;&ndash;who had
never seen the like&ndash;&ndash;stared open-mouthed at the
operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got to <i>make</i> &#8217;em buy,&#8221; Archie declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;H-h-how?&#8221; Billy stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got to make <i>&#8217;em want</i> to,&#8221; said Archie.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll trade if they want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>In return Billy watched Archie scribble.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s this?&#8221; Archie asked, at last.</p>
<p>Billy listened to the reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will that fetch &#8217;em aboard?&#8221; Archie demanded,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would <i>my</i> mother,&#8221; said the astonished
Billy. &#8220;<i>I&#8217;d</i> fetch her, bet yer life!&#8221;</p>
<p>They laboriously set up the handbill and triumphantly
struck it off:</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_8' id='linki_8'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i229a.png' alt='' title='' width='279' height='-1' /><br />
</div>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll fetch &#8217;em, all right!&#8221; Archie declared.
&#8220;Now for the concert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy had another shock of surprise. &#8220;Th-th
<i>what</i>?&#8221; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Concert,&#8221; Archie replied. &#8220;You&#8217;re going to
sing, Billy.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me!&#8221; poor Billy exclaimed in large alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Skipper Bill is, too,&#8221; Archie went on;
&#8220;and Bagg&#8217;s going to double-shuffle, and Bobby
North is going to shake that hornpipe out of
his feet, and Jimmie Grimm is going to recite
&#8216;Sailor Boy, Sailor Boy,&#8217; and I&#8217;m going to do a
trifling little stunt myself. I&#8217;m Se&ntilde;or Fakerino,
Billy,&#8221; Archie laughed, &#8220;the Greatest Magician
in Captivity. <i>Just</i> you wait and see. I think
I&#8217;ll have a bill all to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie scowled and scribbled again with a
result that presently made him chuckle. It appeared
in the handbill (after some desperately
hard work) in this guise:</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_9' id='linki_9'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i230a.png' alt='' title='' width='283' height='-1' /><br />
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>It was late in the afternoon before the last
handbill was off the press; and Billy Topsail
then looked more like a black-face comedian
than senior member of the ambitious firm of
Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company. Archie
was no better&ndash;&ndash;perspiring, ink-stained, tired in
head and hands. But the boys were delighted
with what they had accomplished. There were
two other productions: one announcing the concert
and the other an honest and quiet comparison
of cash and credit prices with a fair exposition
of the virtue and variety of the merchandise to
be had aboard the <i>Spot Cash</i>.</p>
<p>When Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, however, was shown
the concert announcement and informed, much
to his amazement, that it was down in the articles
of agreement, as between him, master of the <i>Spot
Cash</i>, and the firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm
&amp; Company&ndash;&ndash;down in black and white in the
articles of agreement which he was presumed to
have signed&ndash;&ndash;down and no dodging it&ndash;&ndash;that he
was to sing &#8220;The Lost Pirate&#8221; when required&ndash;&ndash;Bill
o&#8217; Burnt Bay was indignant and flatly
resigned his berth.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, skipper,&#8221; Archie drawled. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t sing, I &#8217;low. Billy Topsail has a sweet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
little pipe, an&#8217; I &#8217;low it&#8217;ll be a good deal better to
have him sing twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; Bill gasped, chagrined. &#8220;What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better to have Billy sing twice,&#8221; Archie
repeated indifferently.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay glared at Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy Topsail,&#8221; said Archie, in a way the
most careless, &#8220;has the neatest little pipe on the
coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have you to know,&#8221; Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay
snorted, &#8220;that they&#8217;s many a White Bay liveyere
would pay a <i>dime</i> t&#8217; hear me have a tussle with
&#8216;The Lost Pirate.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie whistled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look you, Archie!&#8221; Skipper Bill demanded;
&#8220;is you goin&#8217; t&#8217; let me sing, or isn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I is,&#8221; Archie laughed.</p>
<p>That was the end of the mutiny.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At peep of dawn the <i>Spot Cash</i> set sail from
Ruddy Cove with flags flying and every rag of
sail spread to a fair breeze. Presently the sun
was out, the sky blue, the wind smartly blowing.
Late in the afternoon she passed within a stone&#8217;s
throw of Mother Burke and rounded Cape John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
into White Bay. Before dark she dropped
anchor in Coachman&#8217;s Cove and prepared for
business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, lads!&#8221; Archie shouted, when the
anchor was down and all sail stowed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
put these dodgers where they&#8217;ll do most good.&#8221;</p>
<p>The handbills were faithfully distributed before
the punts of Coachman&#8217;s came in from the fishing
grounds; and that night, to an audience that
floated in punts in the quiet water, just beyond
the schooner&#8217;s stern, and by the light of four
torches, Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company
presented their first entertainment in pursuit of
business, the performers operating upon a small
square stage which Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had rigged
on the house of the cabin.</p>
<p>It was a famous evening.</p>

Promise to Ruin the Firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company,

Himself</i></p>
<p>Trade was brisk next day&ndash;&ndash;and continued
brisk for a fortnight. From
Coachman&#8217;s Cove to Seal Cove, from
Seal Cove to Black Arm, from Black Arm to
Harbour Round and Little Harbour Deep went
the <i>Spot Cash</i>. She entered with gay signal
flags and a multitude of little Union Jacks flying;
and no sooner was the anchor down than the
phonograph began its musical invitation to draw
near and look and buy. And there was presently
candy for the children; and there were undeniable
bargains for the mothers. In the evening&ndash;&ndash;under
a quiet starlit sky&ndash;&ndash;Skipper Bill &#8220;tussled&#8221;
gloriously with &#8220;The Lost Pirate,&#8221; and Bobby
North shook the hornpipe out of his very toes,
and Bill Topsail wistfully piped the well-loved
old ballads of the coast in a tender treble; and
after that Se&ntilde;or Fakerino created no end of
mystification and applause by extracting half-dollars
from the vacant air, and discovering three
small chicks in an empty top-hat, and producing
eggs at will from Bagg&#8217;s capacious mouth, and
with a mere wave of his wand changing the
blackest of ink into the very most delicious of

<p>Trade followed as a matter of course.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Trade was brisk as any heart could wish up
the White Bay coast to the first harbours of the
northern reaches of the French Shore; and there
it came to an appalling full stop. The concerts
were patronized as before; but no fish came
aboard for exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t bear to look the calendar in the face,&#8221;
Archie complained.</p>
<p>The <i>Spot Cash</i> then lay at anchor in Englee.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis the fifth o&#8217; August,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; Archie whistled. &#8220;Sixteen days
to the first of September!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, anyhow?&#8221; Skipper Bill
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Black Eagle&#8217;s</i> the matter,&#8221; said Archie,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
angrily. &#8220;She&#8217;s swept these harbours clean.
She cleaned out Englee yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand by, all hands!&#8221; roared the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, skipper?&#8221; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; replied the skipper; &#8220;that&#8217;s the
trouble. But the mains&#8217;l <i>will</i> be up afore very
long if there&#8217;s a rope&#8217;s end handy,&#8221; he added.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll chase the <i>Black Eagle</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>They caught the <i>Black Eagle</i> at anchor in
Conch that evening. She was deep in the water.
Apparently her hold was full; there were the first
signs of a deck-load of fish to be observed. In a
run ashore Archie very soon discovered the reason
of her extraordinary success. He returned to
the deck of the <i>Spot Cash</i> in a towering rage.
The clerk of the <i>Black Eagle</i> had put up the
price of fish and cut the price of every pound and
yard of merchandise aboard his vessel. No
wonder she had loaded. No wonder the folk of
the French Shore had emptied their stages of the
summer&#8217;s catch. And what was the <i>Spot Cash</i>
to do? Where was she to get <i>her</i> fish? By
selling at less than cost and buying at more than
the market price? Nothing of the sort! Topsail,
Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company were not going
to be ruined by that sort of folly. Topsail, Armstrong,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Grimm &amp; Company couldn&#8217;t <i>have</i> any
fish. The powerful firm of Armstrong &amp; Company
of St. John&#8217;s was going to put the poor
little firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company
out of business&ndash;&ndash;going to snuff &#8217;em out&ndash;&ndash;<i>had</i>
snuffed &#8217;em out. The best thing Topsail,
Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company could do was to
get to cover and call cash trading as big a failure
as had ever been made in Newfoundland business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t fair!&#8221; Archie complained, aboard the
<i>Spot Cash</i>. &#8220;It&#8217;s dirty business, I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s fire away, anyhow,&#8221; said Jimmie
Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t fair of dad,&#8221; Archie repeated, coming
as near to the point of tears as a boy of his age
well could. &#8220;It&#8217;s a low trick to cut a small
trader&#8217;s throat like this. They can outsail us
and keep ahead of us; and they&#8217;ll undersell and
overbuy us wherever we go. When they&#8217;ve put
us out of business, they&#8217;ll go back to the old
prices. It isn&#8217;t fair of dad,&#8221; he burst out. &#8220;I
tell you, it isn&#8217;t fair!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lend a hand here,&#8221; said Bill. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see
what they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pretense of hauling up the mainsail was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
made aboard the <i>Spot Cash</i>. There was an immediate
stir on the deck of the <i>Black Eagle</i>; the
hands were called from the forecastle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that!&#8221; said Archie, in disgust.</p>
<p>Both crews laughed and gave it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t <i>like</i> your dad,&#8221; said Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you alongside the <i>Black Eagle</i>,
Archie,&#8221; he added, &#8220;an&#8217; you can have a little
yarn with Skipper George.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Skipper George Rumm was glad to see
Archie&ndash;&ndash;glad in a too bland way, in which,
however, Archie did not detect a very obvious
nervousness. Three eighty-five for fish? Yes;
the skipper <i>did</i> believe that Tommy Bull was
paying three eighty-five. No; he didn&#8217;t know
the market price in St. John&#8217;s. Flour and pork
and sugar and tea? No; the skipper didn&#8217;t
know just what Tommy Bull was selling flour
and pork and sugar and tea at. You see,
Tommy Bull was clerk of the <i>Black Eagle</i>; and
that was the clerk&#8217;s business. Tommy Bull was
ashore just then; the skipper didn&#8217;t just quite
know when he&#8217;d come aboard. Were these
prices Sir Archibald&#8217;s orders? Really, Skipper
George didn&#8217;t know. Tommy Bull knew all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
about that; and Tommy Bull had clerked in
these waters long enough to keep the firm&#8217;s
business to himself. Tommy Bull was closemouthed;
he wouldn&#8217;t be likely to blab Sir
Archibald&#8217;s orders in every harbour of the coast
or whisper them in the ear of a rival trading
clerk.</p>
<p>This last thrust was too much for Archie&#8217;s
dignity. He leaped from the deck of the <i>Black
Eagle</i> into his own punt in a greater rage than
ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s t&#8217; be a spell o&#8217; rough weather,&#8221; were
Skipper George&#8217;s last words.</p>
<p>The punt moved away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper Bill,&#8221; said Archie, &#8220;the nearest
telegraph station is at Tilt Cove. Can we make
it in a night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the wind holds,&#8221; the skipper answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>The predicament was explained to Donald
North and Jimmie Grimm and Billy Topsail.
The <i>Spot Cash</i> could have no more fish as long
as the <i>Black Eagle</i> paid three eighty-five with the
St. John&#8217;s market at three thirty-five. But <i>was</i>
the market at three thirty-five? Hadn&#8217;t the
<i>Black Eagle</i> later information? That must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
found out; and from Tilt Cove it could be discovered
in two hours. So up went the sails of
the <i>Spot Cash</i>, and, with the <i>Black Eagle</i> following,
she jockeyed out of the harbour. Presently,
when she had laid a course for Cape John and
Tilt Cove, the <i>Black Eagle</i> came about and beat
back to Conch.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Next morning&ndash;&ndash;and dirty weather was promised
for the day&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Spot Cash</i> dropped anchor
in the shelter of the cliff at Tilt Cove and Billy
Topsail pulled Archie ashore. It was in
Archie&#8217;s heart to accuse his father&#8217;s firm of harsh
dealing with a small competitor; but he resolved
to do no more than ask the price of fish. The
answer would be significant of all that the lad
wished to know; and if the great firm of Armstrong
&amp; Company had determined to put obstacles
in the way of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm
&amp; Company, even to the point of ruin, there was
no help for Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company.
Archie would ask no quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make haste!&#8221; Skipper Bill called from the
deck of the <i>Spot Cash</i>. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no love for this
harbour in a gale o&#8217; wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was poor shelter at best.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Much as I can,&#8221; Archie shouted back.</p>
<p>The boy sent this telegram:</p>
<table summary='message' style='width:22em'><tr><td>
<p class='ta' style='text-align:right'>Tilt Cove, August 6.</p>
<p class='ta'>Armstrong &amp; Company,</p>
<p class='ta' style='margin-left:1em'>St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p class='ta'>Price of fish.</p>
<p class='ta' style='text-align:right'>Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>There was now nothing to do but wait. Sir
Archibald would be in his little office overlooking
his wharves and shipping. It would not be
long. And the reply presently came:</p>
<table summary='message' style='width:22em'><tr><td>
<p class='ta' style='text-align:right'>St. John&#8217;s, August 6.</p>
<p class='ta'>Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company,</p>
<p class='ta' style='margin-left:2em'>Aboard "Spot Cash,"</p>
<p class='ta' style='margin-left:3em'>Tilt Cove.</p>
<p class='ta' style='margin-left:1em'>Still three thirty-five. No rise probable.</p>
<p class='ta' style='text-align:right'>Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Archie Armstrong was hurt. He could hardly
conceive that his father had planned the ruin of
his undertaking and the loss of his honour. But
what was left to think? Would the skipper and
clerk of the <i>Black Eagle</i> deliberately court discharge?
And discharge it would be&ndash;&ndash;discharge
in disgrace. There was no possible excuse for
this amazing change in prices. No; there was
no explanation but that they were proceeding
upon Sir Archibald&#8217;s orders. It was inconceivable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
that they should be doing anything else.
Archie would ask no quarter of his father; but
he would at least let Sir Archibald know that he
was aware of the difference between fair and
unfair competition. Before he boarded the <i>Spot
Cash</i> he dispatched this message:</p>
<table summary='message' style='width:22em'><tr><td>
<p class='ta' style='text-align:right'>Tilt Cove, August 6.</p>
<p class='ta'>Armstrong &amp; Company,</p>

<p class='ta' style='margin-left:2em'>Tilt Cove.</p>
<p class='ta'>&#8220;Black Eagle&#8221; paying three eighty-five. Underselling flour, pork, tea, sugar. Why don&#8217;t you play fair?</p>
<p class='ta' style='text-align:right'>Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>If Archie Armstrong could have been in the
little office which overlooked the wharves to
observe the effect of that message upon Sir
Archibald he would not only have been amazed
but would have come to his senses in a good
deal less time than he actually did. The first
item astounded and bewildered Sir Archibald;
the second&ndash;&ndash;the brief expression of distrust&ndash;&ndash;hurt
him sorely. But he had no time to be
sentimental. Three eighty-five for fish? What
was the meaning of that? Cut prices on flour,
pork, sugar and tea? What was the meaning
of <i>that</i>? Sir Archibald saw in a flash what it
meant to Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
But what did it mean to Armstrong &amp;
Company? Sir Archibald flushed and perspired
with wrath. He pushed buttons&ndash;&ndash;he roared
orders&ndash;&ndash;he scribbled telegrams. In ten minutes,
so vociferous was his rage, so intense his purpose,
it was known from one end of the establishment
to the other that the <i>Black Eagle</i> must be
communicated with at once.</p>
<p>But Armstrong &amp; Company could not manage
to communicate with the <i>Black Eagle</i> direct, it
seemed. Armstrong &amp; Company might, however,
communicate with the <i>Spot Cash</i>, now at
Tilt Cove and possibly bound north. Doubtless
by favour of the clerk of the <i>Spot Cash</i> Armstrong
&amp; Company would be able to speak orders
in the ear of Skipper George Rumm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judd!&#8221; Sir Archibald roared.</p>
<p>The pale little clerk appeared on the bound.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rush this,&#8221; said Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>The message read:</p>
<table summary='message' style='width:22em'><tr><td>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the &#8220;Spot Cash&#8221; is Caught By a Gale In the Night
and Skipper Bill Gives Her Up For Lost</i></p>
<p>It was blowing up when Archie returned to
the <i>Spot Cash</i>. There was a fine rain in
the wind, too; and a mist&ndash;&ndash;hardly yet a fog&ndash;&ndash;was
growing denser on the face of a whitening
sea. Nothing to bother about yet, of course:
only a smart breeze and a little tumble, with
thick weather to make a skipper keep his eyes
open. But there was the threat of heavy wind
and a big sea in gray sky overhead and far out
upon the water. Tilt Cove was no place for the
<i>Spot Cash</i> to lie very long; she must look for
shelter in Sop&#8217;s Arm before night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Archie, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, in the
cozy forecastle with the boys, &#8220;there&#8217;s something
queer about this here <i>Black Eagle</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; Archie sneered. &#8220;It&#8217;s
the first time I ever knew my father not to play
fair.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bosh!&#8221; Skipper Bill ejaculated.</p>
<p>Archie started up in a rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ear the wind!&#8221; said Bagg, with a little
shiver.</p>
<p>It had begun to blow in earnest. The wind,
falling over the cliff, played mournfully in the
rigging. A gust of rain lashed the skylight.
Swells from the open rocked the schooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blowin&#8217; up,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you knowed Sir Archibald?&#8221;
the skipper asked.</p>
<p>Archie laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Off an&#8217; on for about sixteen years, I &#8217;low?&#8221;
said the skipper.</p>
<p>Archie nodded shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ark t&#8217; the wind!&#8221; Bagg whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be all in a tumble off the cape,&#8221; said
Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know Sir Archibald <i>well</i>?&#8221; the skipper
pursued.</p>
<p>Archie sat down in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty intimate, eh?&#8221; asked the skipper.</p>
<p>The boy laughed again; and then all at once&ndash;&ndash;all
in a flash&ndash;&ndash;his ill-humour and suspicion
vanished. His father not play fair? How preposterous
the fancy had been! Of <i>course</i>, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
was playing fair! But somebody wasn&#8217;t. And
<i>who</i> wasn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>&#8220;It is queer,&#8221; said he. &#8220;What do you make
of it, Bill?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I been thinkin&#8217;,&#8221; the skipper replied heavily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you fathomed it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the skipper drawled, &#8220;I&#8217;ve thunk
along far enough t&#8217; want t&#8217; look into it farder.
I&#8217;d say,&#8221; he added, &#8220;t&#8217; put back t&#8217; Conch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to blow, Skipper Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>It had already begun to blow. The wind was
moaning aloft. The long-drawn melancholy
penetrated to the cozy cabin. In the shelter of the
cliff though she was, the schooner tossed in the
spent seas that came swishing in from the
open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; the skipper drawled, &#8220;I guess the
wind won&#8217;t take the hair off a body; an&#8217; I &#8217;low
we can make Conch afore the worst of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with the skipper,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, too,&#8221; said Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>Bagg had nothing to say; he seldom had,
poor fellow! in a gale of wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a telegram to send,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>It was a message of apology. Archie went
ashore with a lighter heart to file it. What an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
unkindly suspicious fool he had been! he reflected,
heartily ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something for you, sir,&#8221; said the agent.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald&#8217;s telegram was put in the boy&#8217;s
hand; and when this had been read aboard the
<i>Spot Cash</i>&ndash;&ndash;and when the schooner had rounded
Cape John and was taking full advantage of a
sudden change of wind to the southwest&ndash;&ndash;Archie
and the skipper and the crew felt very well indeed,
thank you!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It blew hard in the afternoon&ndash;&ndash;harder than
Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had surmised. The wind had
a slap to it that troubled the little <i>Spot Cash</i>.
Crested seas broke over her bows and swept her
deck. She was smothered in white water half
the time. The wind was rising, too. It was to
be a big gale from the southeast. It was already
half a gale. There was wind enough for the
<i>Spot Cash</i>. Much more would shake and drown
her like a chip. Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, at the wheel,
and the crew, forward and amidships, kept watch
for the coast and the friendly landmarks of harbour.
But what with wind and fog and rain it
was a disheartening business.</p>
<p>When night gathered, the coast was not in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
sight. The <i>Spot Cash</i> was tossing somewhere
offshore in a rising gale and dared not venture
in. The wind continued in the southeast. The
coast was a lee shore&ndash;&ndash;all rocks and islands and
cliffs. The <i>Spot Cash</i> must beat out again to
sea and wait for the morning. Any attempt to
make a harbour of that harsh shore in the dark
would spell destruction. But the sea was hardly
more hospitable. The <i>Spot Cash</i>, reefed down
almost to bare poles, and standing out as best
she could, tossed and plunged in the big black
seas, with good heart, to be sure, but, presently,
with small hope. It seemed to Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay
that the little craft would be broken and swamped.</p>
<p>The boys came aft from forward and amidships.
All at once Archie, who had been staring into the
night ahead, started, turned and uttered an ejaculation
of dismay, which a gust of wind drove
into the skipper&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, b&#8217;y?&#8221; Skipper Bill roared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to insure her,&#8221; shouted Archie.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ruin if we wreck, Bill,&#8221; Archie shouted
again.</p>
<p>It looked to Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay like wreck and
death. If so, the ruin might take care of itself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
It pleased him to know that Archie was still unconcerned
about his life. He reflected that if
the <i>Spot Cash</i> should by any chance survive he
would tell Sir Archibald that story. But a great
sea and a smothering blast of wind distracted
him. The sea came clear over the bow and
broke amidships; the wind fairly drove the
breath back into the skipper&#8217;s throat. There
would be two more seas he knew: there were
always three seas. The second would break in
a moment; the third would swamp the schooner.
He roared a warning to the boys and turned the
wheel to meet the sea bow on. The big wave
fell with a crash amidships; the schooner stopped
and shivered while a torrent of water drove clear
over the stern. Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay saw the crest
of the third sea grow white and tower in the
night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang to her!&#8221; screamed Archie.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill smiled grimly as the sea came
aboard. It broke and swept past. He expected
no more; but more came&ndash;&ndash;more and still more.
The schooner was now tossing in a boiling pot
from which the spray rose like steam. Bill
caught the deep boom of breakers. The <i>Spot
Cash</i> was somewhere inshore. The water was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
shallowing. She was fairly on the rocks. Again
Bill shouted a warning to the boys to save themselves
when she struck. He caught sight of a
low cliff&ndash;&ndash;a black shadow above a mass of
moving, ghostly white. The schooner was lifted
by a great sea and carried forward. Skipper
Bill waited for the shock and thud of her striking.
He glanced up at the spars&ndash;&ndash;again screamed
a warning&ndash;&ndash;and stood rigid. On swept the
schooner. She was a long time in the grip of
that great wave.</p>
<p>Then she slipped softly out of the rough water
into some placid place where the wind fluttered
gently down from above.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>There was a moment of silence and uttermost
amazement. The wind had vanished; the roar
of the sea was muffled. The schooner advanced
gently into the dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anchor!&#8221; the skipper gasped.</p>
<p>He sprang forward, stumbling; but it was too
late: the bowsprit crumpled against a rock,
there was a soft thud, a little shock, a scraping,
and the <i>Spot Cash</i> stopped dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re aground,&#8221; said Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonders where?&#8221; said Jimmie Grimm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In harbour, anyhow,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;And no insurance!&#8221; Archie added.</p>
<p>There was no levity in this. The boys were
overawed. They had been afraid, every one of
them; and the mystery of their escape and
whereabouts oppressed them. But they got the
anchor over the bow; and presently they had
the cabin stove going and were drying off.
Nobody turned in; they waited anxiously for
the first light of day to disclose their surroundings.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Opportunity is Afforded the Skipper of the &#8220;Black
Eagle&#8221; to Practice Villainy in the Fog and He Quiets His
Scruples. In Which, also, the Pony Islands and the Tenth of the
Month Come Into Significant Conjunction</i></p>
<p>Aboard the <i>Black Eagle</i>, Skipper George
Rumm and Tommy Bull, with the cook
and three hands, all of Tom Tulk&#8217;s careful
selection, were engaged, frankly among themselves,
in a conspiracy to wreck the schooner for
their own profit. It was a simple plan; and with
fortune to favour rascality, it could not go awry.
Old Tom Tulk of Twillingate had conceived
and directed it. The <i>Black Eagle</i> was to be
loaded with salt-cod from the French Shore
stages in haste and at any cost. She was then
to be quietly taken off one of the out-of-the-way
rocky little islands of the remote northern coast.
Her fish and the remainder of her cargo were to
be taken ashore and stowed under tarpaulin:
whereupon&ndash;&ndash;with thick weather to corroborate a
tale of wreck&ndash;&ndash;the schooner was to be scuttled in
deep water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis but a matter o&#8217; clever management,&#8221;
Tom Tulk had said. &#8220;Choose your weather&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the castaways were to appear in
Conch in the schooner&#8217;s quarter boat with a
circumstantial account of the disaster. The
<i>Black Eagle</i> was gone, they would say; she had
struck in a fog, ripped out her keel (it seemed),
driven over the rock, filled and sunk. At Conch,
by this time, the mail-boat would be due on the
southward trip. Skipper George and the clerk
would proceed in grief and humiliation to St.
John&#8217;s to report the sad news to Armstrong &amp;
Company; but the cook and the three hands
would join Tom Tulk at Twillingate, whence
with the old reprobate&#8217;s schooner they would
rescue fish and cargo from beneath the tarpaulins
on the out-of-the-way rocky little island in the
north. To exchange crews at Twillingate and
run the cargo to St. John&#8217;s for quick sale was a
small matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barrin&#8217; accident,&#8221; Tom Tulk had said, &#8220;it
can&#8217;t fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>There, indeed, was a cold, logical plan.
&#8220;Barrin&#8217; accident,&#8221; as Tom Tulk was aware, and
as he by and by persuaded Skipper George, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
could not fail. Let the weather be well chosen, the
story consistent: that was all. Was not Skipper
George forever in danger of losing his schooner?
Had not Sir Archibald already given him his last
warning? They would say in St. John&#8217;s merely
that Skipper George had &#8220;done it at last.&#8221;
Nobody would be surprised; everybody would
say, &#8220;I told you so.&#8221; And when old Tom Tulk
came into harbour with a mysterious load of fish
who would suspect him? Was not Tom Tulk
known to be an eccentric? Was there any accounting
for what Tom Tulk would do? Tom
Tulk would say, &#8220;Mind your business!&#8221; and
that would make an end of the questioning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Choose your weather, Skipper George,&#8221; said
Tom Tulk. &#8220;Let it be windy and thick.&#8221;</p>
<p>With fog to hide the deed&ndash;&ndash;with a gale to
bear out the story and keep prying craft away&ndash;&ndash;there
would be small danger of detection. And
what if folk did suspect? Let &#8217;em prove it!
<i>That&#8217;s</i> what the law demanded. Let &#8217;em <i>prove</i>
it!</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the <i>Black Eagle</i> put back to Conch
from following the little <i>Spot Cash</i>, it was evident
that the opportunity had come. The weather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
was thick; there was a promise of wind in the
air. Moreover, with Archie Armstrong on the
coast in a temper, it was the part of wisdom to
beware. Skipper George went gloomily to the
cabin when the schooner rode once more at
anchor. It was time, now; he knew it, the clerk
knew it, the crew knew it. But Skipper George
had no liking for the job; nor had the clerk, to
tell the truth, nor had the cook, nor had the
crew. Rascals are not made in a day; and it
takes a long time to innure them against fear
and self-reproach. But skipper and crew of the
<i>Black Eagle</i> were already committed. Their
dealing for fish on the coast had been unpardonable.
The skipper could not explain it in St.
John&#8217;s; nor could the clerk excuse it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got t&#8217; go through with this, Tommy,&#8221; said
the gloomy skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a dram,&#8221; the clerk replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
sore need o&#8217; one meself.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed the skipper was, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;With that little shaver on the coast,&#8221; said the
clerk, &#8220;&#8217;tis best done quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no heart for it,&#8221; the skipper growled.</p>
<p>The clerk&#8217;s thin face was white and drawn.
His hand trembled, now, as he lifted his glass.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
Nor had <i>he</i> any heart for it. It had been all very
well, at first; it had seemed something like a
lark&ndash;&ndash;just a wild lark. The crew, too, had taken
it in the spirit of larking&ndash;&ndash;at first. But now that
the time was come both forecastle and cabin had
turned uneasy and timid.</p>
<p>In the forecastle, the cook said to the first
hand:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I was out o&#8217; this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht I&#8217;d never come in it,&#8221; the first hand
sighed.</p>
<p>Their words were in whispers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; said the second hand, with a scared
glance about, &#8220;that the ol&#8217; man will&ndash;&ndash;will <i>do</i> it&ndash;&ndash;the
morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three averted their eyes&ndash;&ndash;each from the
other&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; the cook gasped.</p>
<p>Meantime, in the cabin, the clerk, rum now
giving him a saucy outlook, said: &#8220;&#8217;Twill blow
half a gale the morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; said the skipper, uneasily; &#8220;an&#8217; there&#8217;s
like t&#8217; be more than half a gale by the glass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be few craft out o&#8217; harbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Few craft, Tommy,&#8221; said the skipper,
drawing a timid hand over his bristling red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
beard. &#8220;I&#8217;m not likin&#8217; t&#8217; take the <i>Black Eagle</i>
t&#8217; sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis like there&#8217;ll be fog,&#8221; the clerk continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay; &#8217;tis like there&#8217;ll be a bit o&#8217; fog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper and clerk helped themselves to another
dram of rum. Why was it that Tom Tulk had
made them a parting gift? Perhaps Tom Tulk
understood the hearts of new-made rascals. At
any rate, skipper and clerk, both simple fellows,
after all, were presently heartened.</p>
<p>Tommy Bull laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper,&#8221; said he, &#8220;do you go ashore an&#8217;
say you&#8217;ll take the <i>Black Eagle</i> t&#8217; sea the
morrow, blow high or blow low, fair wind or
foul.&#8221;</p>
<p>The skipper looked up in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders,&#8221; the clerk explained, grinning.
&#8220;Tell &#8217;em you&#8217;ve been wigged lively enough by
Sir Archibald for lyin&#8217; in harbour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper George laughed in his turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;For&#8217;ard, there!&#8221; the clerk roared, putting his
head out of the cabin. &#8220;One o&#8217; you t&#8217; take the
skipper ashore!&#8221;</p>
<p>Three fishing-schooners, bound down from the
Labrador, had put in for safe berth through a
threatening night. And with the skippers of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
these craft, and with the idle folk ashore, Skipper
George foregathered. Dirty weather? (the
skipper declared); sure, &#8217;twas dirty weather.
But there was no wind on that coast could keep
the <i>Black Eagle</i> in harbour. No, sir: no wind
that blowed. Skipper George was sick an&#8217; tired
o&#8217; bein&#8217; wigged by Sir Archibald Armstrong for
lyin&#8217; in harbour. No more wiggin&#8217; for <i>him</i>. No,
sir! He&#8217;d take the <i>Black Eagle</i> t&#8217; sea in the
mornin&#8217;? Let it blow high or blow low, fair
wind or foul, &#8217;twould be up anchor an&#8217; t&#8217; sea for
the <i>Black Eagle</i> at dawn. Wreck her? Well,
let her <i>go</i> t&#8217; wreck. Orders was orders. If the
<i>Black Eagle</i> happened t&#8217; be picked up by a rock
in the fog &#8217;twould be Sir Archibald Armstrong&#8217;s
business to explain it. As for Skipper George,
no man would be able t&#8217; tell <i>him</i> again that he
was afraid t&#8217; take his schooner t&#8217; sea. An&#8217;
orders was orders, sir. Yes, sir; orders was
orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likin&#8217; the job o&#8217; takin&#8217; my schooner
t&#8217; sea in wind an&#8217; fog,&#8221; Skipper George concluded,
with a great assumption of indignant courage;
&#8220;but when I&#8217;m told t&#8217; drive her, <i>I&#8217;ll drive</i>, an&#8217;
let the owner take the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>This impressed the Labrador skippers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Small blame t&#8217; you, Skipper George,&#8221; one
declared, &#8220;if you do lose her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well satisfied with the evidence he had manufactured
to sustain the story of wreck, Skipper
George returned to the schooner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he drawled to the clerk, &#8220;I got my
witnesses. They isn&#8217;t a man ashore would put t&#8217;
sea the morrow if the weather comes as it promises.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk sighed and anxiously frowned.
Skipper George, infected by this melancholy and
regret&ndash;&ndash;for the skipper loved the trim, fleet-footed,
well-found <i>Black Eagle</i>&ndash;&ndash;Skipper George
sighed, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time t&#8217; turn in, Tommy,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>The skipper had done a good stroke of business
ashore. Sir Archibald had indeed ordered
him to &#8220;drive&#8221; the <i>Black Eagle</i>.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And in the rising wind of the next day while
the <i>Spot Cash</i> lay at anchor in Tilt Cove and
Archie&#8217;s messages were fleeting over the wire
to St. John&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Black Eagle</i> was taken to sea.
Ashore they advised her skipper to stick to
shelter; but the skipper would have none of
their warnings. Out went the <i>Black Eagle</i> under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
shortened sail. The wind rose; a misty rain
gathered; fog came in from the far, wide open.
But the <i>Black Eagle</i> sped straight out to sea. Beyond
the Pony Islands&ndash;&ndash;a barren, out-of-the-way
little group of rocks&ndash;&ndash;she beat aimlessly to and fro:
now darting away, now approaching. But there
was no eye to observe her peculiar behaviour.
Before night fell&ndash;&ndash;driven by the gale&ndash;&ndash;she found
poor shelter in a seaward cove. Here she hung
grimly to her anchorage through the night.
Skipper and crew, as morning approached, felt
the wind fall and the sea subside.</p>
<p>Dawn came in a thick fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you make of it, Tommy?&#8221; the
skipper asked.</p>
<p>The clerk stared into the mist. &#8220;Pony
Islands, skipper, sure enough,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Pony or Big?&#8221;</p>
<p>In a rift of the mist a stretch of rocky coast lay
exposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little Pony,&#8221; said the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; the skipper agreed: &#8220;an&#8217; &#8217;twas Little
Pony, easterly shore,&#8221; he added, his voice dwindling
away, &#8220;that Tom Tulk advised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; about the tenth o&#8217; the month,&#8221; Tommy
Bull added.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the Fog Thins and the Crew of the &#8220;Spot Cash&#8221; Fall
Foul of a Dark Plot</i></p>
<p>Morning came to the <i>Spot Cash</i>, too&ndash;&ndash;morning
with a thick mist: morning
with a slow-heaving sea and a
vanished wind. Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay looked about&ndash;&ndash;stared
in every direction from the listed little
schooner&ndash;&ndash;but could find no familiar landmark.
They were in some snug harbour, however, of a
desolate and uninhabited coast. There were no
cottages on the hills; there were no fish-flakes
and stages by the waterside. Beyond the tickle&ndash;&ndash;that
wide passage through which the schooner
had driven in the dark&ndash;&ndash;the sea was heaving
darkly under the gray mist. Barren, rugged
rock fell to the harbour water; and rocky hills,
stripped of verdure by the winds of a thousand
years, hid their bald heads in the fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it <i>is</i>,&#8221; said Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay to the boys; &#8220;but I know well enough what
it <i>ought</i> t&#8217; be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis never the Shore,&#8221; Billy Topsail declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8217;lowin&#8217;,&#8221; said Skipper Bill, but yet doubtfully,
&#8220;that &#8217;tis one o&#8217; the Pony Islands. They
lies hereabouts,&#8221; he continued, scratching his
head, &#8220;long about thirty mile off the mainland.
We&#8217;re on a westerly shore, and that means
Islands, for we&#8217;ve never come t&#8217; the westerly
coast o&#8217; Newfoundland. If I could get a peep at
the Bald-head I could tell for certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grim landmark called the Bald-head,
however,&ndash;&ndash;if this were indeed one of the Pony
Islands&ndash;&ndash;was in the mist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay &#8217;tis the Pony Islands,&#8221; Billy Topsail
declared again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be,&#8221; said the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Little Pony, too,&#8221; Billy went on. &#8220;I
mind me now that we sheltered in this harbour
in the <i>Fish Killer</i> afore she was lost on Feather&#8217;s
Folly.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low <i>&#8217;tis</i>,&#8221; Skipper Bill agreed.</p>
<p>Whether the Pony Islands or not&ndash;&ndash;and whether
Big Pony or Little Pony&ndash;&ndash;clearing weather would
disclose. Meantime, as Archie Armstrong somewhat
tartly pointed out, the <i>Spot Cash</i> was to be
looked to. She had gone aground at low tide,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
it seemed; and she was now floating at anchor,
free of the bottom. The butt of her bowsprit had
been driven into the forecastle; and the bowsprit
itself had gone permanently out of commission.
Otherwise she was tight and ready. The practical-minded
Archie Armstrong determined, with
a laugh, that notwithstanding the loss of a bowsprit
the firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp;
Company would not have to go out of business
for lack of insurance. And after an amazingly
hearty and hilarious breakfast, which Bagg, the
cook&ndash;&ndash;Bagg <i>was</i> the cook&ndash;&ndash;presently announced,
the folk of the <i>Spot Cash</i> went ashore to take observations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll rig a bowsprit o&#8217; some sort,&#8221; Bill o&#8217;
Burnt Bay remarked, &#8220;afore the fog lifts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fog was already thinning.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Meantime, on the easterly coast of the Little
Pony, the <i>Black Eagle</i> was being warped in
towards shore and moored with lines to a low,
sheer rock, which served admirably as a landing
wharf. The gangplank was run out, the hatches
were lifted, the barrows were fetched from below;
and all these significant operations were directed
in a half-whisper by the rat-eyed little Tommy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
Bull. Ashore went the fish&ndash;&ndash;ashore by the
barrow-load&ndash;&ndash;and into a convenient little gully
where the tarpaulins would keep it snug against
the weather. Fortune favoured the plan: fog hid
the island from the sight of all men. But the
faces of the crew grew longer as the work advanced;
and the voice of the rat-eyed little clerk
fell lower, and his manner turned still more furtive,
and his hand began to shake.</p>
<p>In the cabin the skipper sat, with an inspiring
dram, engaged in melancholy and apprehensive
brooding. Armstrong &amp; Company had not
served him ill, after all (thought he); but, pshaw!
the <i>Black Eagle</i> was insured to the hilt and
would be small loss to the firm. Well, well! she
was a tight little schooner and had many a time
taken the evil fall weather with a stout heart.
&#8217;Twas a pity to scuttle her. Scuttle her? The
skipper had much rather scuttle Tom Tulk!
But pshaw! after all &#8217;twould but make more work
for Newfoundland ship-builders. Would it never
be known? Would the murder never out?
Could Tommy Bull and the crew be trusted?
The skipper had already begun to fear Tommy
Bull and the crew. He had caught himself deferring
to the cook.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>To the cook!</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; thought the skipper, as he tipped his
bottle, &#8220;George Rumm knucklin&#8217; down to a cook!
A pretty pass t&#8217; come to!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tommy Bull came down the ladder. &#8220;Skipper,
sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;you&#8217;d best be on deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper George went above with the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gettin&#8217; light,&#8221; said Tommy Bull.</p>
<p>At that moment the skipper started. With a
hoarse ejaculation leaping from his throat he
stared with bulging eyes towards the hills upon
which a shaft of sunlight had fallen. Then he
gripped Tommy Bull by the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; the terrified clerk exclaimed.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s what, man? Where&ndash;&ndash;where? What
you talkin&#8217; about?&#8221;</p>
<p>The skipper pointed to the patch of sunlight
on the hills. &#8220;That!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a man!&#8221; said the clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re cotched!&#8221; the skipper groaned.</p>
<p>The rat-like little clerk bared his teeth.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay and the boys of the <i>Spot Cash</i>
had seen what the lifting fog disclosed&ndash;&ndash;the <i>Black
Eagle</i> moored to the rocks of the Little Pony and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
unloading. But they had not fathomed the
mystery. A mystery it was, however, and a deep
one. To solve it they came down the hill towards
the schooner in a body and were presently
face to face with skipper and clerk on the deck.
The crew went on with the unloading; there was
never a hint of hesitation or embarrassment.
And the skipper of the <i>Spot Cash</i> was serenely
made welcome. Whatever rat-like impulse to
bite may have been in the heart of the little
clerk, when Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay came over the crest
of the hill, it had now vanished in discreet politeness.
There was no occasion for biting. Had
there been&ndash;&ndash;had the crew of the <i>Black Eagle</i> been
caught in the very act of scuttling the ship&ndash;&ndash;Tommy
Bull would no doubt have driven his
teeth in deep. Even amateur scoundrels at bay
may be highly dangerous antagonists. These
were amateur scoundrels, to be sure, and good-hearted
in the main; but they were not yet by
any means at bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; a little leak, Skipper Bill,&#8221; Skipper
George explained, when Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay had
accounted for his presence in Little Pony.
&#8220;Sprung it in the gale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, now?&#8221; said Skipper Bill, suspiciously;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
&#8220;&#8217;tis lucky we happened along. I&#8217;m a
bit of a carpenter, meself, an&#8217; I&#8217;d&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; Skipper George protested, with
a large wave of the hand. &#8220;<i>Not</i> at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twould be no trouble&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all!&#8221; Skipper George repeated.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s Tommy just found the spot, an&#8217; we&#8217;ll
plug it in short order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper Bill could ill conceal his suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in trouble yourself with the <i>Spot Cash</i>,
says you,&#8221; said Skipper George. &#8220;We&#8217;ll lend
you a spar an&#8217; a couple o&#8217; hands t&#8217; set it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll buy the spar,&#8221; Archie put in.</p>
<p>Skipper George laughed heartily. &#8220;Well,
well,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Have it your own way. You
make your repairs, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll make mine; an&#8217; then
we&#8217;ll see who&#8217;s back t&#8217; the Shore ports first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie bethought himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lay you,&#8221; Skipper George went on, clapping
Archie on the back, &#8220;that you&#8217;ll not find a
fish in the harbours where the <i>Black Eagle</i> goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re ordered home, Skipper George,&#8221; said
Archie. &#8220;I&#8217;ve this message from Tilt Cove.&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper George glanced at the telegram.
&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; said he, blandly; &#8220;we&#8217;re nigh
loaded, anyhow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>Archie wondered afterwards why Skipper
George had caught his breath and lost some of
his colour.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Presently the crew of the <i>Spot Cash</i>, with two
stout hands from the <i>Black Eagle</i>, went over the
hills with the spare spar. Skipper George and
Tommy Bull made haste to the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ordered home,&#8221; said the skipper, slapping
the message on the counter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forthwith,&#8221; Tommy Bull added.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more here than appears,&#8221; the anxious
skipper went on. &#8220;Tommy,&#8221; said he, gravely,
&#8220;there&#8217;s something back o&#8217; this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk beat a devil&#8217;s tattoo in perturbation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more suspected than these words
tell,&#8221; the skipper declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis by sheer good luck, Skipper George,&#8221;
said the clerk, &#8220;that we&#8217;ve a vessel t&#8217; take home.
I tell you, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said he, flushing with suspicion
and rage, &#8220;I don&#8217;t trust Tom Tulk. He&#8217;d sell
his mother for a slave for a thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom Tulk!&#8221; Skipper George exclaimed.
&#8220;By thunder!&#8221; he roared, &#8220;Tom Tulk has
blowed!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>For the second time that day the rat-like little
clerk of the <i>Black Eagle</i> bared his teeth&ndash;&ndash;now
with a little snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve no proof,&#8221; said the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; the clerk agreed; &#8220;but they&#8217;s as
many as two lost jobs aboard this vessel.
They&#8217;ll be two able-bodied seamen lookin&#8217; for
a berth when the <i>Black Eagle</i> makes St. John&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Tommy Bull,&#8221; said the skipper, with a
shrug, &#8220;&#8217;tis the clerk that makes prices aboard a
tradin&#8217; schooner; and &#8217;twill be the clerk that will
explain in this particular case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; Tommy Bull sneered.</p>
<p>Next day the <i>Black Eagle</i>, with her fish again
aboard, put to sea and sped off on a straight
course for St. John&#8217;s. Notwithstanding the difficulties
in store, clerk and skipper were in good
humour with all the world (except Tom Tulk);
and the crew was never so light-hearted since
the voyage began. But as the day drew along&ndash;&ndash;and
as day by day passed&ndash;&ndash;and as the home
port and Sir Archibald&#8217;s level eyes came ever
nearer&ndash;&ndash;the skipper grew troubled. Why should
the <i>Black Eagle</i> have been ordered home?
Why had Sir Archibald used that mysterious
and unusual word &#8220;forthwith&#8221; with such emphasis?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
What lay behind the brusque order?
Had Tom Tulk played false? Would there be
a constable on the wharf? With what would
Sir Archibald charge the skipper? Altogether,
the skipper of the <i>Black Eagle</i> had never sailed
a more disquieting voyage. And when the <i>Black
Eagle</i> slipped through the narrows to St. John&#8217;s
harbour he was like a dog come home for a
thrashing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the &#8220;Spot Cash&#8221; is Picked up by Blow-Me-Down Rock
In Jolly Harbour, Wreckers Threaten Extinction and the Honour of
the Firm Passes into the Keeping of Billy Topsail</i></p>
<p>The <i>Spot Cash</i> made for the French Shore
with all the speed her heels could command.
The seventh of August! How
near it was to the first of September! The firm
of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company, with
the skipper and cook, shivered to think of it.
Ten more trading days! Not another hour
could they afford if the <i>Spot Cash</i> would surely
make St. John&#8217;s harbour on the specified day.
And she would&ndash;&ndash;she must&ndash;&ndash;Archie declared.
His honour was involved&ndash;&ndash;the honour of them
all&ndash;&ndash;of the firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp;
Company. Had not Sir Archibald said so?</p>
<p>So in the harbours of the Shore Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay once more tussled valiantly with &#8220;The Lost
Pirate,&#8221; and the flags flew, and the phonograph
ground out inviting music, and Bobby North
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
shook the hornpipe out of his active toes, and
Bagg double-shuffled, and the torches flared, and
&#8220;Kandy for Kids&#8221; and &#8220;Don&#8217;t be Foolish and
Fully Fooled&#8221; persuaded the populace, and
Signor Fakerino created mystification, and Billy
Topsail employed his sweet little pipe most wistfully
in the old ballad of the coast:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Sure, the chain &#8217;e parted,<br />
An&#8217; the schooner drove ashore,<br />
An&#8217; the wives of the &#8217;ands<br />
Never saw un any more,<br />
No more!<br />
Never saw un any mo-o-o-re!&#8221;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>It was all to good purpose. Trade was even
brisker than in White Bay. Out went the
merchandise and in came the fish. Nor did the
<i>Spot Cash</i> once leave harbour without a hearty,
even wistful, invitation to return. Within seven
days, so fast did the fish come aboard, the hold
had an appearance of plethora. Jimmie Grimm
and Bagg protested that not another quintal of
fish could be stowed away. It was fairly time to
think of a deck-load. There was still something
in the cabin: something to be disposed of&ndash;&ndash;something
to turn into fish. And it was Archie
who proposed the scheme of riddance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A bargain sale,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The very thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; Jolly Harbour&#8217;s the place,&#8221; said the
skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then homeward bound!&#8221; shouted Archie.</p>
<p>They ran into Jolly Harbour on the wings of
a brisk southerly wind&ndash;&ndash;and unfortunately in the
dusk brought up hard and fast on Blow-Me-Down
Rock.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Aground! They were hard and fast aground
on Blow-Me-Down Rock in Jolly Harbour at
high tide. A malignant sea made a certainty of
it. It lifted the <i>Spot Cash</i>&ndash;&ndash;drove her on&ndash;&ndash;and
gently deposited her with a horrifying list to
starboard. Archie Armstrong wrung his hands
and stamped the deck. Where was the first of
September now? How was the firm to&ndash;&ndash;to&ndash;&ndash;what
was it Sir Archibald had said?&ndash;&ndash;yes; how
was the firm to &#8220;liquidate its obligations&#8221; on
the appointed day and preserve its honour?</p>
<p>&#8220;By gettin&#8217; the <i>Spot Cash</i> afloat,&#8221; said Skipper
Bill, tersely.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a pretty time we&#8217;ll have,&#8221; groaned
Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low,&#8221; Bill drawled, &#8220;that we may be in for
a prettier time still.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, it couldn&#8217;t be worse,&#8221; Billy Topsail declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;This here,&#8221; Bill explained, &#8220;is Jolly Harbour;
an&#8217; the folk o&#8217; Jolly Harbour isn&#8217;t got no reputations
t&#8217; speak of.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was hardly enlightening.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I means,&#8221; Skipper Bill went on, &#8220;is
that the Jolly Harbour folk is called wreckers.
They&#8217;s been a good deal o&#8217; talk about wreckers
on this coast; an&#8217; they&#8217;s more lies than truth in
it. But Jolly Harbour,&#8221; he added, &#8220;is Jolly
Harbour; an&#8217; the folk will sure come swarmin&#8217;
in punts and skiffs an&#8217; rodneys when they hear
they&#8217;s a vessel gone ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, they&#8217;ll give us help,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; Skipper Bill scornfully exclaimed.
&#8220;&#8217;Tis little help <i>they&#8217;ll</i> give us. Why, b&#8217;y, when
they&#8217;ve got her cargo, they&#8217;ll chop off her standing
rigging and draw the nails from her deck
planks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a mean, sinful thing to do!&#8221; cried Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They live up to their lights, b&#8217;y,&#8221; the skipper
said. &#8220;They&#8217;re an honest, good-hearted, God-fearin&#8217;
folk on this coast in the main; but they
believe that what the sea casts up belongs to men
who can get it, and neither judge nor preacher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
can teach them any better. Here lies the <i>Spot
Cash</i>, stranded, with a wonderful list t&#8217; starboard.
They&#8217;ll think it no sin to wreck her. I know
them well. &#8217;Twill be hard to keep them off
once they see that she&#8217;s high and dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie began to stamp the deck again.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>When the dawn broke it disclosed the situation
of the schooner. She was aground on a submerged
rock, some distance offshore, in a wide
harbour. It was a wild, isolated spot, with
spruce-clad hills, which here and there showed
their rocky ribs rising from the edge of the
water. There was a cluster of cottages in a
ravine at the head of the harbour; but there was
no other sign of habitation.</p>
<p>Evidently the schooner&#8217;s deep list betrayed her
distress; for when the day had fully broken, a
boat was pushed off from the landing-place and
rowed rapidly towards her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the first!&#8221; muttered Skipper Bill.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll warn him well.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hailed the occupant, a fisherman with a
simple, good-humoured face, who hung on his
oars and surveyed the ship.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep off, there!&#8221; shouted the skipper. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
need no man&#8217;s help. I warn you an&#8217; your mates
fair not to come aboard. You&#8217;ve no right here
under the law so long as there&#8217;s a man o&#8217; the
crew left on the ship, and I&#8217;ll use force to keep
you off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not able to get her off, sir,&#8221; said the
fisherman, rowing on, as if bent on boarding.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a wreck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; the skipper ordered, &#8220;get forward
with a gaff and keep him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that the fisherman turned his punt about
and made off for the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, Billy!&#8221; he called, good-naturedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you no call to strike me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come back with others,&#8221; the skipper remarked,
gloomily. &#8220;&#8217;Tis a bad lookout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to haul her off with the punt,&#8221; suggested
Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the punt!&#8221; the skipper laughed.
&#8220;&#8217;Twould be as easy to haul Blow-Me-Down
out by the roots. But if we can keep the
wreckers off, by trick or by force, we&#8217;ll not lose
her. The <i>Grand Lake</i> passed up the coast on
Monday. She&#8217;ll be steamin&#8217; into Hook-and-Line
again on Thursday. As she doesn&#8217;t call at Jolly
Harbour we&#8217;ll have t&#8217; go fetch her. We can run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
over in the punt an&#8217; fetch her. &#8217;Tis a matter o&#8217;
gettin&#8217; there and back before the schooner&#8217;s torn
t&#8217; pieces.&#8221;</p>
<p>At dawn of the next day Skipper Bill determined
to set out for Hook-and-Line to intercept
the steamer. In the meantime there had
been no sign of life ashore. Doubtless, the crew
of the <i>Spot Cash</i> thought, the news of the wreck
was on its way to neighbouring settlements.
The wind had blown itself out; but the sea was
still running high, and five hands (three of them
boys) were needed to row the heavy schooner&#8217;s
punt through the lop and distance. Muscle was
needed for the punt; nothing but wit could save
the schooner. Who should stay behind?</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Archie stay behind,&#8221; said Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Skipper Bill replied; &#8220;he&#8217;ll be needed t&#8217;
bargain with the captain o&#8217; the <i>Grand Lake</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy,&#8221; said the skipper, &#8220;you&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy nodded shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Billy Topsail,&#8221; Skipper Bill went on,
&#8220;I fear you&#8217;ve never read the chapter on&#8217; Wreck
an&#8217; Salvage&#8217; in the &#8216;Consolidated Statutes o&#8217;
Newfoundland.&#8217; So I&#8217;m going t&#8217; tell you some
things you don&#8217;t know. Now, listen careful!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
By law, b&#8217;y,&#8221; tapping the boy on the breast with
a thick, tarry finger, &#8220;if they&#8217;s nobody aboard a
stranded vessel&ndash;&ndash;if she&#8217;s abandoned, as they say
in court&ndash;&ndash;the men who find her can have her and
all that&#8217;s in her. That&#8217;s pretty near the law o&#8217; the
land&ndash;&ndash;near enough for you, anyway. Contrary,
by law, b&#8217;y,&#8221; with another impressive tap, &#8220;if
they is one o&#8217; the crew aboard, he&#8217;s a right to
shoot down any man who comes over the side
against his will. That&#8217;s <i>exactly</i> the law. Do
you follow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve no mind for shootin&#8217; at so good-natured
a man,&#8221; said Billy, recalling the fisherman&#8217;s
broad grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I hope you won&#8217;t have to,&#8221; said the
skipper. &#8220;But they&#8217;s no harm in aiming an
empty gun anywhere you&#8217;ve a mind to. So far
as I know, they&#8217;s no harm in firin&#8217; away a blast
or two o&#8217; powder if you forget t&#8217; put in the shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, boy,&#8221; said Archie, tremulously, &#8220;it&#8217;s
up to you to save the firm of Topsail, Armstrong,
Grimm &amp; Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Archie,&#8221; said Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Archie declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s just two things to remember,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
the skipper, from the bow of the punt, before
casting off. &#8220;The first is to stay aboard; the
second is to let nobody else come aboard if you
can help it. &#8217;Tis all very simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, skipper,&#8221; said Billy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Topsail&ndash;&ndash;Armstrong&ndash;&ndash;Grimm&ndash;&ndash;<i>and</i>&ndash;&ndash;Company,&#8221;
were the last words Billy Topsail heard;
and they came from Archie Armstrong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which the &#8220;Grand Lake&#8221; Conducts Herself In a Most
Peculiar Fashion to the Chagrin of the Crew of the &#8220;Spot
Cash&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Skipper Bill and the punt of the stranded
<i>Spot Cash</i> made the harbour at Hook-and-Line
in good season to intercept the
<i>Grand Lake</i>. She was due&ndash;&ndash;she would surely
steam in&ndash;&ndash;that very day, said the men of Hook-and-Line.
And it seemed to Archie Armstrong
that everything now depended on the <i>Grand
Lake</i>. It would be hopeless&ndash;&ndash;Skipper Bill had
said so and the boys needed no telling&ndash;&ndash;it would
be hopeless to attempt to get the <i>Spot Cash</i> off
Blow-Me-Down Rock in an unfriendly harbour
without the steamer&#8217;s help.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis fair hard t&#8217; believe that the Jolly Harbour
folk would give us no aid,&#8221; said Jimmie Grimm.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve no knowledge
o&#8217; Jolly Harbour,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a big expense these robbers are putting
us to,&#8221; Archie growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robbers?&#8221; Bill drawled. &#8220;Well, they&#8217;re a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
decent, God-fearin&#8217; folk, with their own ideas
about a wreck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie sniffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no doubt,&#8221; the skipper returned, &#8220;that
they&#8217;re thankin&#8217; God for the windfall of a tradin&#8217;
schooner at family worship in Jolly Harbour at
this very minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>This view expressed small faith in the wits of
Billy Topsail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Billy Topsail will stand un off,&#8221; Jimmie
Grimm stoutly declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doubtin&#8217; it,&#8221; said the frank skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-wh-<i>what</i>!&#8221; Archie exclaimed in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just doubtin&#8217; it,&#8221; the skipper repeated.</p>
<p>This was a horrifying confession; and Archie
Armstrong knew that Skipper Bill was not only
wise in the ways of the French Shore but was
neither a man to take a hopeless view nor one
needlessly to excite anxiety. When Bill o&#8217; Burnt
Bay admitted his fear that Billy Topsail had
neither the strength nor the wit to save the <i>Spot
Cash</i> from the God-fearing folk of Jolly Harbour,
he meant more than he said. The affairs of Topsail,
Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company seemed to
be in a bad way. It was now more than a mere
matter of liquidating an obligation on the first of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
September; the problem was of liquidating it at
all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht the <i>Grand Lake</i> would &#8217;urry up,&#8221; said
Bagg.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like t&#8217; save some splinters o&#8217; the schooner,
anyway,&#8221; the skipper chuckled, in a ghastly way,
&#8220;even if we <i>do</i> lose the cargo.&#8221;</p>
<p>It occurred all at once to Archie Armstrong
that Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company
were not only in obligation for the debt to Armstrong
&amp; Company but were responsible for a
chartered craft which was not insured.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;a cold thousand dollars&ndash;&ndash;<i>and</i>
the <i>Spot Cash</i>!&#8221; he exclaimed, aghast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht she&#8217;d &#8217;urry up,&#8221; Bagg repeated.</p>
<p>Archie, pacing the wharf, his hands deep in
his pockets, his face haggard and white, recalled
that his father had once told him that many a
man had been ruined by having too large a
credit. And Archie had had credit&ndash;&ndash;much
credit. A mere boy with a thousand dollars of
credit! With a thousand dollars of credit in
merchandise and coin and the unquestioned
credit of chartering a schooner! He realized
that it had been much&ndash;&ndash;too much. Somehow
or other, as he feverishly paced the wharf at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
Hook-and-Line, the trading venture seemed infinitely
larger and more precarious than it had
in his father&#8217;s office on the rainy day when the
lad had so blithely proposed it. He understood,
now, why it was that other boys could not stalk
confidently into the offices of Armstrong &amp; Company
and be outfitted for a trading voyage.</p>
<p>His father&#8217;s faith&ndash;&ndash;his father&#8217;s indulgent fatherhood&ndash;&ndash;had
provided the all-too-large credit for his ruin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht she&#8217;d &#8217;urry up,&#8221; Bagg sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just now,&#8221; Archie declared, looking Skipper
Bill in the eye, &#8220;it&#8217;s up to Billy Topsail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy&#8217;s a good boy,&#8221; said the skipper.</p>
<p>Little Donald North&ndash;&ndash;who had all along been
a thoroughly serviceable but inconspicuous member
of the crew&ndash;&ndash;began to shed unwilling tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht she&#8217;d &#8217;urry up,&#8221; Bagg whimpered.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>There she is!</i>&#8221; Skipper Bill roared.</p>
<p>It was true. There she was. Far off at sea&ndash;&ndash;away
beyond Grief Head at the entrance to
Hook-and-Line&ndash;&ndash;the smoke of a steamer surely
appeared, a black cloud in the misty, glowering
day. It was the <i>Grand Lake</i>. There was no
other steamer on the coast. Cap&#8217;n Hand&ndash;&ndash;Archie&#8217;s
friend, Cap&#8217;n Hand, with whom he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
sailed on the sealing voyage of the stout old
<i>Dictator</i>&ndash;&ndash;was in command. She would soon
make harbour. Archie&#8217;s load vanished; from
despair he was lifted suddenly into a wild hilarity
which nothing would satisfy but a roaring wrestle
with Skipper Bill. The <i>Grand Lake</i> would
presently be in; she would proceed full steam to
Jolly Harbour, she would pass a line to the <i>Spot
Cash</i>, she would jerk the little schooner from her
rocky berth on Blow-Me-Down, and presently
that selfsame wilful little craft would be legging
it for St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p>But was it the <i>Grand Lake</i>?</p>
<p>&#8220;Lads,&#8221; the skipper declared, when the
steamer was in view, &#8220;it sure is the <i>Grand
Lake</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>They watched her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer!&#8221; Skipper Bill muttered, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s queer?&#8221; asked Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;She should be turnin&#8217; in,&#8221; the skipper replied.
&#8220;What&#8217;s Cap&#8217;n Hand thinkin&#8217; about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht she&#8217;d &#8217;urry up,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>The boys were bewildered. The steamer
should by this time have had her nose turned
towards Hook-and-Line. To round Grief Head
she was keeping amazingly far out to sea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wonderful queer!&#8221; said the anxious skipper.</p>
<p>The <i>Grand Lake</i> steamed past Hook-and-Line
and disappeared in the mist. Evidently she was
in haste. Presently there was not so much as a
trail of smoke to be descried at sea.</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Billy Topsail, Besieged by Wreckers, Sleeps on Duty
and Thereafter Finds Exercise For His Wits. In Which, also, a
Lighted Candle is Suspended Over a Keg of Powder and
Precipitates a Critical Moment While Billy Topsail Turns Pale
With Anxiety</i></p>
<p>At Jolly Harbour, meantime, where Billy
Topsail kept watch, except for the flutter
of an apron or skirt when the women
went to the well for water, there was no sign of
life at the cottages the livelong day. No boats
ran out to the fishing-grounds; no men were on
the flakes; the salmon nets and lobster-traps were
not hauled. Billy prepared a spirited defense
with the guns, which he charged heavily with
powder, omitting the bullets. This done, he
awaited the attack, meaning to let his wits or his
arms deal with the situation, according to developments.</p>
<p>The responsibility was heavy, the duty anxious;
and Billy could not forget what Archie had said
about the firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp;
Company.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low there was nothing for it but t&#8217; leave me
in charge,&#8221; he thought, as he paced the deck that
night. &#8220;But &#8217;twill be a job now to save her if
they come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy fancied, from time to time, that he heard
the splash of oars; but the night was dark, and
although he peered long and listened intently, he
could discover no boat in the shadows. And
when the day came, with the comparative security
of light, he was inclined to think that his fancy
had been tricking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it might have been the punts slippin&#8217; in
from the harbours above and below,&#8221; he thought,
suddenly. &#8220;I wonder if &#8217;twas.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spent most of that day lying on a coil of
rope on the deck of the cabin&ndash;&ndash;dozing and delighting
himself with long day-dreams. When
the night fell, it fell dark and foggy. An easterly
wind overcast the sky and blew a thick mist from
the open sea. Lights twinkled in the cottages
ashore, somewhat blurred by the mist; but elsewhere
it was dark; the nearer rocks were outlined
by their deeper black.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twill be now,&#8221; Billy thought, &#8220;or &#8217;twill be
never. Skipper Bill will sure be back with the
<i>Grand Lake</i> to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>Some time after midnight, while Billy was pacing
the deck to keep himself warm and awake, he
was hailed from the shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis from the point at the narrows,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;Sure, &#8217;tis Skipper Bill come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he heard the hail&ndash;&ndash;his own name, coming
from that point at the narrows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, b&#8217;y! Billy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, sir! Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper Bill, b&#8217;y!&#8221; came the answer.
&#8220;Fetch the quarter-boat. We&#8217;re aground and
leakin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, lad! I wants t&#8217; get aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy leaped from the rail to the quarter-boat.
He was ready to cast off when he heard a splash
in the darkness behind him. That splash gave
him pause. Were the wreckers trying to decoy
him from the ship? They had a legal right
to salve an abandoned vessel. He clambered
aboard, determined, until he had better assurance
of the safety of his charge, to let Skipper Bill and
his crew, if it were indeed they, make a shift for
comfort on the rocks until morning. &#8220;Skipper
Bill, sir!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Can you swim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, b&#8217;y! But make haste.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show a light for you, sir, if you want t&#8217;
swim out, but I&#8217;ll not leave the schooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that there was a laugh&ndash;&ndash;an unmistakable
chuckle&ndash;&ndash;sounding whence the boy had heard
the splash of an oar. It was echoed to right and
left. Then a splash or two, a creak or two and a
whisper. After that all was still again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis lucky, now, I didn&#8217;t go,&#8221; Billy thought.
&#8220;&#8217;Twas a trick, for sure. But how did they
know my name?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was simple enough, when he came to
think about it. When the skipper had warned
the first fisherman off, he had ordered Billy forward
by name. Wreckers they were, then&ndash;&ndash;simple,
good-hearted folk, believing in their
right to what the sea cast up&ndash;&ndash;and now bent on
&#8220;salving&#8221; what they could, but evidently seeking
to avoid a violent seizure of the cargo.</p>
<p>Billy appreciated this feeling. He had himself
no wish to meet an assault in force, whether in
the persons of such good-natured fellows as the
man who had grinned at him on the morning of
the wreck, or in those of a more villainous cast.
He hoped it was to be a game of wits; and now
the lad smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis likely,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;that I&#8217;ll keep it safe.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>For an hour or more there was no return of
the alarm. The harbour water rippled under the
winds; the rigging softly rattled and sang aloft;
the swish of breakers drifted in from the narrows.</p>
<p>Billy sat full in the light of the deck lamps,
with a gun in his hands, that all the eyes, which
he felt sure were peering at him from the darkness
roundabout, might see that he was alive to
duty.</p>
<p>As his weariness increased, he began to think
that the wreckers had drawn off, discouraged.
Once he nodded; again he nodded, and awoke
with a start; but he was all alone on the deck,
as he had been.</p>
<p>Then, to occupy himself, he went below to
light the cabin candle. For a moment, before
making ready to go on deck again, he sat on the
counter, lost in thought. He did not hear the
prow of a punt strike the <i>Spot Cash</i> amidships,
did not hear the whispers and soft laughter of
men coming over the side by stealth, did not
hear the tramp of feet coming aft. What startled
him was a rough voice and a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come aboard, skipper, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>The companionway framed six weather-beaten,
bearded faces. There was a grin on each, from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
the first, which was clear to its smallest wrinkle
in the candle-light, to those which were vanishing
and reappearing in the shadows behind.
Billy seemed to be incapable of word or action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to report, sir,&#8221; said the nearest
wrecker. &#8220;We seed you was aground, young
skipper, and we thought we&#8217;d help you ashore
with the cargo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy rested his left hand on the head of a
powder keg, which stood on end on the counter
beside him. His right stole towards the candlestick.
There was a light in his blue eyes&ndash;&ndash;a
glitter or a twinkle&ndash;&ndash;which might have warned
the wreckers, had they known him better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I order you ashore!&#8221; he said, slowly. &#8220;I
order you <i>all</i> ashore. You&#8217;ve no right aboard
this ship. If I had my gun&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, you left it on deck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had my gun,&#8221; Billy pursued, &#8220;I&#8217;d have
the right t&#8217; shoot you down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The manner of the speech&ndash;&ndash;the fierce intensity
of it&ndash;&ndash;impressed the wreckers. They perceived
that the boy&#8217;s face had turned pale, that his eyes
were flashing strangely. They were unused to
such a depth of passion. It may be that they
were reminded of a bear at bay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he&#8217;d do it,&#8221; said one.</p>
<p>An uneasy quiet followed; and in that silence
Billy heard the prow of another punt strike the
ship. More footfalls came shuffling aft&ndash;&ndash;other
faces peered down the companionway. One
man pushed his way through the group and
made as if to come down the ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back!&#8221; Billy cried.</p>
<p>The threat in that shrill cry brought the man
to a stop. He turned; and that which he saw
caused him to fall back upon his fellows. There
was an outcry and a general falling away from
the cabin door. Some men ran forward to the
punts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lad&#8217;s gone mad!&#8221; said one. &#8220;Leave
us get ashore!&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy had whipped the stopper out of the hole
in the head of the powder keg, had snatched the
candle from the socket, carefully guarding its
flame, and now sat, triumphantly gazing up,
with the butt of the candle through the hole in
the keg and the flame flickering above its depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men,&#8221; said he, when they had gathered
again at the door, &#8220;if I let that candle slip
through my fingers, you know what&#8217;ll happen.&#8221;
He paused; then he went on, speaking in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
quivering voice: &#8220;My friends left me in charge
o&#8217; this here schooner, and I&#8217;ve been caught nappin&#8217;.
If I&#8217;d been on deck, you wouldn&#8217;t have
got aboard. But now you are aboard, and &#8217;tis
all because I didn&#8217;t do my duty. Do you think
I care what becomes o&#8217; me now? Do you think
I don&#8217;t care whether I do my duty or not? I
tell you fair that if you don&#8217;t go ashore I&#8217;ll drop
the candle in the keg. If one o&#8217; you dares come
down that ladder, I&#8217;ll drop it. If I hear you lift
the hatches off the hold, I&#8217;ll drop it. If I hear
you strike a blow at the ship, I&#8217;ll drop it. Hear
me?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t go, I&#8217;ll drop it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The candle trembled between Billy&#8217;s fingers.
It slipped, fell an inch or more, but his fingers
gripped it again before he lost it. The wreckers
recoiled, now convinced that the lad meant no
less than he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;d do it, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said the man who
had attempted to descend. &#8220;Sure,&#8221; he repeated,
with a glance of admiration for the boy&#8217;s pluck,
&#8220;I guess you would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis not comfortable here,&#8221; said another.
&#8220;Sure, he might drop it by accident. Make
haste, b&#8217;ys! Let&#8217;s get ashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, skipper, sir!&#8221; said the first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, sir!&#8221; said Billy, grimly.</p>
<p>With that they went over the side. Billy
heard them leap into the punts, push off, and
row away. Then silence fell&ndash;&ndash;broken only by
the ripple of the water, the noise of the wind in
the rigging, the swish of breakers drifting in.
The boy waited a long time, not daring to
venture on deck, lest they should be lying in
wait for him at the head of the ladder. He
listened for a footfall, a noise in the hold, the
shifting of the deck cargo; but he heard nothing.</p>
<p>When the candle had burned low, he lighted
another, put the butt through the hole, and
jammed it. At last he fell asleep, with his head
resting on a pile of dress-goods; and the candle
was burning unattended. He was awakened by
a hail from the deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy, b&#8217;y, where is you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Skipper Bill&#8217;s hearty voice; and before
Billy could tumble up the ladder, the skipper&#8217;s
bulky body closed the exit.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all safe, sir!&#8221; said the boy.</p>
<p>Skipper Bill at that moment caught sight of
the lighted candle. He snatched it from its
place, dropped it on the floor and stamped on
it. He was a-tremble from head to foot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this foolery?&#8221; he demanded, angrily.</p>
<p>Billy explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was plucky, b&#8217;y,&#8221; said the skipper, &#8220;but
&#8217;twas wonderful risky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, there was no call to be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No call to be afraid!&#8221; cried the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir&ndash;&ndash;no,&#8221; said Billy. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a
grain of powder in the keg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Empty&ndash;&ndash;an empty keg?&#8221; the skipper roared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; said Billy, indignantly,
&#8220;that I&#8217;d have risked the schooner that way
if &#8217;twas a full keg?&#8221;</p>
<p>Skipper Bill stared; and for a long time afterwards
he could not look at Billy without staring.</p>

</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Skipper Bill, as a Desperate Expedient, Contemplates
the Use of His Teeth, and Archie Armstrong, to Save His Honour,
Sets Sail in a Basket, But Seems to Have Come a Cropper</i></p>
<p>Billy Topsail suddenly demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the <i>Grand Lake</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>Grand Lake</i>,&#8221; Skipper Bill
drawled, with a sigh, &#8220;is somewheres t&#8217; the
s&#8217;uth&#8217;ard footin&#8217; it for St. John&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You missed her!&#8221; Billy accused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t neither,&#8221; said the indignant skipper.
&#8220;She steamed right past Hook-an&#8217;-Line without
a wink in that direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was shocking news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said little Donald North, as
though it mattered importantly, &#8220;we seed her
smoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Billy looked from Donald to Jimmie, from
Jimmie to Bagg, from Bagg to the skipper; and
then he stared about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Archie?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Archie,&#8221; the skipper replied, &#8220;is footin&#8217; it
for St. John&#8217;s, too. &#8216;Skipper Bill,&#8217; says Archie,
&#8216;Billy Topsail has kep&#8217; that schooner safe. I
knows he has. It was up t&#8217; Billy Topsail t&#8217; save
the firm from wreckers an&#8217; I&#8217;ll lay you that Billy
Topsail has saved the firm. Now, Skipper Bill,&#8217;
says Archie, &#8216;you go back t&#8217; Jolly Harbour an&#8217;
get that schooner off. You get her off somehow.
Get her off jus&#8217; as soon as you can,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;an&#8217; fetch her to St. John&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> get her off,&#8217; says I.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, you can, too, Skipper Bill,&#8217; says he.
&#8216;I&#8217;ll lay you can get her off. I don&#8217;t know
how you&#8217;ll do it,&#8217; says he; &#8216;but <i>I&#8217;ll lay you
can</i>!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ll get her off, Archie,&#8217; says I, &#8216;if I got t&#8217;
jump in the sea an&#8217; haul her off with a line in
my teeth.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I knowed you would,&#8217; says he; &#8216;an&#8217; you got
the best teeth, Skipper Bill,&#8217; says he, &#8216;t&#8217; be found
on this here coast. As for me, skipper,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; down t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s if I got t&#8217; walk on
water. I told my father that I&#8217;d be in his office
on the first o&#8217; September&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; be
there. If I can&#8217;t be there with the fish I can
be there with the promise o&#8217; fish; an&#8217; I can back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
that promise up with a motor boat, a sloop
yacht an&#8217; a pony an&#8217; cart. I don&#8217;t know how
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; get t&#8217; St. John&#8217;s,&#8217; says he, &#8216;an&#8217; I
don&#8217;t want t&#8217; walk on a wet sea like this; but
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; get there somehow by the first o&#8217;
September, an&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to assoom&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;yes, sir,
&#8216;<i>assoom</i>, Skipper Bill,&#8217; says Archie&ndash;&ndash;&#8216;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to
assoom that you&#8217;ll fetch down the <i>Spot Cash</i> an&#8217;
the tail an&#8217; fins of every last tom-cod aboard that
there craft.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;m goin&#8217; t&#8217; <i>do</i> it!&#8221; Skipper Bill roared
in conclusion, with a slap of the counter with his
hairy fist that made the depleted stock rattle on
the shelves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does you t-t-think you c-c-<i>can</i> haul her off
with your teeth?&#8221; Donald North asked with
staring eyes.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay burst into a shout of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have no help from the Jolly Harbour
folk,&#8221; said Billy Topsail, gravely. &#8220;They&#8217;re
good-humoured men,&#8221; he added, &#8220;but they means
t&#8217; have this here schooner if they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Skipper Bill, with an assumption
of far more hope than was in his honest,
willing heart. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get her off afore they
comes again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wisht you&#8217;d &#8217;urry up,&#8221; said Bagg.</p>
<p>With the <i>Spot Cash</i> high and dry&ndash;&ndash;with a
small crew aboard&ndash;&ndash;with a numerous folk, clever
and unfriendly (however good-humoured they
were), bent on possessing that which they were
fully persuaded it was their right to have&ndash;&ndash;with
no help near at hand and small prospect of the
appearance of aid&ndash;&ndash;the task which Archie Armstrong
had set Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay was the most
difficult one the old sea-dog had ever encountered
in a long career of hard work, self-dependence
and tight places. The Jolly Harbour folk might
laugh and joke, they might even offer sympathy,
they might be the most hospitable, tender-hearted,
God-fearing folk in the world; but tradition had
taught them that what the sea cast up belonged
righteously to the men who could take it, and
they would with good consciences and the best
humour in the world stand upon that doctrine.
And Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay would do no murder to
prevent them: it was not the custom of the coast
to do murder in such cases; and Archie Armstrong&#8217;s
last injunction had been to take no lives.</p>
<p>Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay declared in growing wrath to
the boys that he would come next door to murder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pink &#8217;em, anyhow,&#8221; said he, as he loaded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
his long gun. &#8220;<i>I&#8217;ll</i> makes holes for earrings,
ecod!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, sir; the skipper would show the Jolly
Harbour folk how near a venturesome man could
come to letting daylight into a Jolly Harbour hull
without making a hopeless leak. Jus&#8217; t&#8217; keep &#8217;em
busy calking, ecod! How much of this was mere
loud and saucy words&ndash;&ndash;with how much real meaning
the skipper spoke&ndash;&ndash;even the skipper himself
did not know. But, yes, sir; he&#8217;d show &#8217;em in
the morning. It was night, now, however&ndash;&ndash;though
near morning. Nobody would put out
from shore before daybreak. They had been
frightened off once. Skipper Bill&#8217;s wrath could
simmer to the boiling point. But a watch must
be kept. No chances must be taken with the
<i>Spot Cash</i>, and&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahoy, Billy!&#8221; a pleasant voice called from
the water.</p>
<p>The crew of the <i>Spot Cash</i> rushed on deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; another voice laughed. &#8220;Skipper&#8217;s
back, too, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>With</i> a long&ndash;&ndash;perfeckly trustworthy&ndash;&ndash;loaded&ndash;&ndash;gun,&#8221;
Skipper Bill solemnly replied.</p>
<p>The men in the punts laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheer off!&#8221; Skipper Bill roared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>But in the protecting shadows of the night the
punts came closer. And there was another
laugh.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>It chanced at Hook-and-Line Harbour before
night&ndash;&ndash;Skipper Bill had then for hours been gone
towards Jolly Harbour&ndash;&ndash;that a Labrador fishing
craft put in for water. She was loaded deep;
her decks were fairly awash with her load of
fish, and at best she was squat and old and rotten&ndash;&ndash;a
basket to put to sea in. Here was no
fleet craft; but she was south-bound, at any rate,
and Archie Armstrong determined to board her.
To get to St. John&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;to open the door of his
father&#8217;s office on the first of September as he had
promised&ndash;&ndash;to explain and to reassure and even
to present in hard cash the value of a sloop
yacht and a pony and a motor boat&ndash;&ndash;was the
boy&#8217;s feverish determination. He could not forget
his father&#8217;s grave words: &#8220;Your honour is
involved.&#8221; Perhaps he exaggerated the importance
of them. His honour? The boy had no
wish to be excused&ndash;&ndash;had no liking for fatherly
indulgence. He was wholly intent upon justifying
his father&#8217;s faith and satisfying his own sense
of honourable obligation. It must be fish or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
cash&ndash;&ndash;fish or cash&ndash;&ndash;and as it seemed it could not
be fish it must therefore be cash.</p>
<p>It must be hard cash&ndash;&ndash;cash down&ndash;&ndash;paid on
the first of September over his father&#8217;s desk in
the little office overlooking the wharves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Green Bay bound,&#8221; the skipper of the
Labrador craft replied to Archie&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>That signified a landing at Ruddy Cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go along,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;ll not,&#8221; the skipper snapped. &#8220;Ye&#8217;ll not
go along until ye mend your manners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie started in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You&#8217;ll</i> go along, will ye?&#8221; the skipper continued.
&#8220;Is you the owner o&#8217; this here craft?
Ye may <i>ask</i> t&#8217; go along; but whether ye go or
not is for me&ndash;&ndash;for <i>me</i>, ye cub!&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie straightened in his father&#8217;s way. &#8220;My
name,&#8221; said he, shortly, &#8220;is Archibald Armstrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The skipper instantly touched his cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, skipper,&#8221; Archie went on, with a
dignity of which his manner of life had long ago
made him unconsciously master, &#8220;for having
taken too much for granted. I want passage
with you to Ruddy Cove, skipper, for which I&#8217;ll
pay.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome, sir,&#8221; said the skipper.</p>
<p>The <i>Wind and Tide</i> lay at Hook-and-Line that
night in fear of the sea that was running. She
rode so deep in the water, and her planks and
rigging and sticks were at best so untrustworthy,
that her skipper would not take her to sea. Next
morning, however&ndash;&ndash;and Archie subsequently recalled
it&ndash;&ndash;next morning the wind blew fair for
the southern ports. Out put the old craft into a
rising breeze and was presently wallowing her
way towards Green Bay and Ruddy Cove. But
there was no reckless sailing. Nothing that
Archie could say with any appearance of propriety
moved the skipper to urge her on. She
was deep, she was old; she must be humoured
along. Again, when night fell, she was taken
into harbour for shelter. The wind still blew
fair in the morning; she made a better day of it,
but was once more safely berthed for the night.
Day after day she crept down the coast, lurching
along in the light, with unearthly shrieks of pain
and complaint, and lying silent in harbour in the
dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Wisht she&#8217;d &#8217;urry up,&#8217;&#8221; thought Archie, with
a dubious laugh, remembering Bagg.</p>
<p>It was the twenty-ninth of August and coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
on dark when the boy first caught sight of the
cottages of Ruddy Cove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mail-boat day,&#8221; he thought, jubilantly. &#8220;The
<i>Wind and Tide</i> will make it. I&#8217;ll be in St. John&#8217;s
the day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Journey&#8217;s end,&#8221; said the skipper, coming up
at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wanting to make the mail-boat,&#8221; said
Archie. &#8220;She&#8217;s due at Ruddy Cove soon after
dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be on time,&#8221; said the skipper.
&#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie heard the faint blast of a steamer&#8217;s
whistle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it she?&#8221; asked the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay,&#8221; Archie exclaimed; &#8220;and she&#8217;s just leaving
Fortune Harbour. She&#8217;ll be at Ruddy Cove
within the hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doubtin&#8217; that <i>we</i> will,&#8221; said the skipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you not run up a topsail?&#8221; the boy
pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for the queen o&#8217; England,&#8221; the skipper
replied, moving forward. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got my load&ndash;&ndash;an&#8217;
I&#8217;ve got the lives o&#8217; my crew&ndash;&ndash;t&#8217; care for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie could not gainsay it. The <i>Wind and
Tide</i> had all the sail she could carry with unquestionable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
safety. The boy watched the mail-boat&#8217;s
lights round the Head and pass through
the tickle into the harbour of Ruddy Cove.
Presently he heard the second blast of her deep-toned
whistle and saw her emerge and go on her
way. She looked cozy in the dusk, he thought:
she was brilliant with many lights. In the morning
she would connect with the east-bound cross-country
express at Burnt Bay. And meantime
he&ndash;&ndash;this selfsame boastful Archie Armstrong&ndash;&ndash;would
lie stranded at Ruddy Cove. At that
moment St. John&#8217;s seemed infinitely far away.</p>

</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>In Which Many Things Happen: Old Tom Topsail Declares Himself
the Bully to Do It, Mrs. Skipper William Bounds Down the Path
With a Boiled Lobster, the Mixed Accommodation Sways, Rattles,
Roars, Puffs and Quits on a Grade in the Wilderness, Tom Topsail
Loses His Way in the Fog and Archie Armstrong Gets Despairing
Ear of a Whistle</i></p>
<p>At Ruddy Cove, that night, when Archie
was landed from the <i>Wind and Tide</i>, a
turmoil of amazement instantly gave
way to the very briskest consultation the wits of
the place had ever known.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no punt can make Burnt Bay the
night,&#8221; Billy Topsail&#8217;s father declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor the morrow night if the wind changes,&#8221;
old Jim Grimm added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor the next in a southerly gale,&#8221; Job North
put in.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the <i>Wind an&#8217; Tide</i>,&#8221; Tom Topsail
suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a basket,&#8221; said Archie; &#8220;and she&#8217;s
slower than a paddle punt.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the weather?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fair wind for Burnt Bay an&#8217; a starlit night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost the express,&#8221; said Archie, excitedly.
&#8220;I must&ndash;&ndash;I <i>must</i>, I tell you!&ndash;&ndash;I must catch the
mixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ruddy Cove faces grew long.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must,&#8221; Archie repeated between his teeth.</p>
<p>The east-bound cross-country express would
go through the little settlement of Burnt Bay in
the morning. The mixed accommodation would
crawl by at an uncertain hour of the following
day. It was now the night of the twenty-ninth
of August. One day&ndash;&ndash;two days. The mixed
accommodation would leave Burnt Bay for
St. John&#8217;s on the thirty-first of August.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she doesn&#8217;t forget,&#8221; said Job North, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or get tired an&#8217; rest too often,&#8221; Jim Grimm
added.</p>
<p>Archie caught an impatient breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look you, lad!&#8221; Tom Topsail declared,
jumping up. &#8220;I&#8217;m the bully that will put you
aboard!&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie flung open the door of Mrs. Skipper
William&#8217;s kitchen and made for the Topsail
wharf with old Tom puffing and lumbering at
his heels. Billy Topsail&#8217;s mother was hailed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
with the news. Before Tom had well made the
punt shipshape for a driving cruise up the Bay
she was on the wharf with a bucket of hardtack
and a kettle of water. A frantic scream&ndash;&ndash;perhaps,
a shout&ndash;&ndash;announced the coming of Mrs.
Skipper William with a ham-bone and a greatcoat.
These tossed inboard, she roared a command
to delay, gathered up her skirts and fled
into the night, whence she emerged, bounding,
with a package of tea and a boiled lobster.
She had no breath left to bid them Godspeed
when Tom Topsail cast off; but she waved her
great soft arms, and her portly person shook
with the violence of her good wishes. And up
went the sail&ndash;&ndash;and out fluttered the little jib&ndash;&ndash;and
the punt heeled to the harbour breeze&ndash;&ndash;and
Tom Topsail and Archie Armstrong darted away
from the lights of Ruddy Cove towards the open
sea.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The mixed accommodation, somewhere far
back in the Newfoundland wilderness, came to
the foot of a long grade. She puffed and
valiantly choo-chooed. It was desperately hard
work to climb that hill. A man might have
walked beside her while she tried it. But she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
surmounted the crest, at last, and, as though immensely
proud of herself, rattled down towards
the boulder-strewn level at an amazing rate of
speed. On she went, swaying, puffing, roaring,
rattling, as though she had no intention whatever
of coming to a stop before she had brought her
five hundred mile run to a triumphant conclusion
in the station at St. John&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Even the engineer was astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doin&#8217; fine,&#8221; thought the fireman, proud of his
head of steam.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll make up them three hours afore
mornin&#8217;,&#8221; the engineer hoped.</p>
<p>On the next grade the mixed accommodation
lagged. It was a steep grade. She seemed to
lose enthusiasm with every yard of puffing progress.
She began to pant&ndash;&ndash;to groan&ndash;&ndash;to gasp
with horrible fatigue. Evidently she fancied it
a cruel task to be put to. And the grade was
long&ndash;&ndash;and it was outrageously steep&ndash;&ndash;and they
had overloaded the little engine with freight cars&ndash;&ndash;and
she wasn&#8217;t yet half-way up. It would take
the heart out of any engine. But she buckled to,
once more, and trembled and panted and gained
a yard or two. It was hard work; it was killing
work. It was a ghastly outrage to demand such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
effort of <i>any</i> engine, most of all of a rat-trap attached
to a mixed accommodation on an ill-graded
road. The Rat-Trap snorted her indignation.
She howled with agony and despair.</p>
<p>And then she quit.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; a passenger asked
the conductor, in a coach far in the rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me as if we&#8217;d have to uncouple and
run on to the next siding with half the train,&#8221;
the conductor replied. &#8220;But it <i>may</i> be the fire-box.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the fire-box?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a habit of droppin&#8217; out,&#8221; said the
conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be a day late in St. John&#8217;s,&#8221; the passenger
grumbled.</p>
<p>The conductor laughed. &#8220;You will,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;if the trouble is with the fire-box.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>While the mixed accommodation was panting
on the long grade, Tom Topsail&#8217;s punt, Burnt
Bay bound, was splashing through a choppy sea,
humoured along by a clever hand and a heart that
understood her whims. It was blowing smartly;
but the wind was none too much for the tiny
craft, and she was making the best of it. At this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
rate&ndash;&ndash;with neither change nor failure of the wind&ndash;&ndash;Tom
Topsail would land Archie Armstrong in
Burnt Bay long before the accommodation had begun
to think of achieving that point in her journey
across the island. There was no failure of
the wind as the night spent itself; it blew true and
fair until the rosy dawn came softly out of the
east. The boy awoke from a long doze to find
the punt overhauling the first barren islands of
the long estuary at the head of which the Burnt
Bay settlement is situated.</p>
<p>With the most favourable weather there was a
day&#8217;s sailing and more yet to be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the weather?&#8221; was Archie&#8217;s first question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Broodin&#8217;,&#8221; Tom Topsail drawled.</p>
<p>Archie could find no menace in the dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; broodin&#8217;,&#8221; Topsail repeated.</p>
<p>Towards night it seemed that a change and a
gale of wind might be hatched by the brooding
day. The wind fluttered to the east and blew up
a thickening fog.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve time an&#8217; t&#8217; spare,&#8221; said Topsail, in the
soggy dusk. &#8220;Leave us go ashore an&#8217; rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>They landed, presently, on a promising island,
and made a roaring fire. The hot tea and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
lobster and the hard-bread&ndash;&ndash;and the tales of Topsail&ndash;&ndash;and
the glow and warmth of the fire&ndash;&ndash;were
grateful to Archie. He fell sound asleep, at last,
with his greatcoat over him; and Tom Topsail
was soon snoring, too. In the meantime the
mixed accommodation, back in the wilderness,
had surmounted the grade, had dropped three
heavy cars at a way station, and was rattling on her
way towards Burnt Bay with an energy and determination
that surprised her weary passengers and
could only mean that she was bound to make up
at least some lost time or explode in the attempt.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Morning came&ndash;&ndash;it seemed to Archie Armstrong
that it never would come&ndash;&ndash;morning came in a
thick fog to Tom Topsail and the lad. In a general
way Tom Topsail had his bearings, but he
was somewhat doubtful about trusting to them.
The fog thickened with an easterly wind. It
blew wet and rough and cold. The water, in so
far as it could be seen from the island, was breaking
in white-capped waves; and an easterly wind
was none of the best on the Burnt Bay course.
But Tom Topsail and Archie put confidently out.
The mixed accommodation was not due at Burnt
Bay until 12:33. She would doubtless be late;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
she was always late. There was time enough;
perhaps there would be time and to spare. The
wind switched a bit to the south of east, however,
and became nearly adverse; and down
came the fog, thick and blinding. A hundred
islands, and the narrowing main-shore to port
and starboard, were wiped out of sight. There
were no longer landmarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Man,&#8221; Tom Topsail declared, at last, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know where I is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive on, Tom,&#8221; said Archie.</p>
<p>The punt went forward in a smother of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half after eleven,&#8221; Archie remarked.</p>
<p>Tom Topsail hauled the sheet taut to pick
up another puff of wind. An hour passed.
Archie had lost the accommodation if she were
on time.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;s an island dead ahead,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;I feels it. Hark!&#8221; he added. &#8220;Does you
hear the breakers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie could hear the wash of the sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be Right-In-the-Way?&#8221; Tom
Topsail wondered. &#8220;Or is it Mind-Your-Eye
Point?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no help in Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;If &#8217;tis Right-In-the-Way,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;I&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
have me bearin&#8217;s. &#8217;Tis a marvellous thick fog,
this,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>Mind-Your-Eye is a point of the mainland.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; ashore t&#8217; find out,&#8221; Tom determined.</p>
<p>Landed, however, he could make nothing of
it. Whether Right-In-the-Way, an island near
by Burnt Bay, or Mind-Your-Eye, a long projection
of the main-shore, there was no telling.
The fog hid all outlines. If it were Right-In-the-Way,
Tom Topsail could land Archie in Burnt
Bay within half an hour; if it were Mind-Your-Eye
point&ndash;&ndash;well, maybe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221; Tom exclaimed.</p>
<p>Archie could hear nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you not hear it?&#8221; said Tom.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, man? Hear <i>what</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That!</i>&#8221; Tom ejaculated.</p>
<p>Archie heard the distant whistle of a train.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knows this place,&#8221; Tom burst out, in vast
excitement. &#8220;&#8217;Tis Mind-Your-Eye. They&#8217;s a
cut road from here t&#8217; the railway. &#8217;Tis but half
a mile, lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Followed by Archie, Tom Topsail plunged
into the bush. They did not need to be told
that the mixed accommodation was labouring on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
a steep grade from Red Brook Bridge. They
did not need to be told that a little fire, builded
by the track before she ran past, a flaring signal
in the fog, would stop her. With them it was
merely a problem of getting to the track in time
to start that fire.</p>

<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:4.0em; '><i>And Last: In Which Archie Armstrong Hangs His Head in His
Father&#8217;s Office, the Pale Little Clerk Takes a Desperate Chance,
Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay Loses His Breath, and there is a Grand Dinner
in Celebration of the Final Issue, at Which the Amazement of the
Crew of the &#8220;Spot Cash&#8221; is Equalled by Nothing in the World
Except Their Delight</i></p>
<p>It was the first of September. A rainy day,
this, in St. John&#8217;s: the wind in the east,
thick fog blowing in from the open. Sir
Archibald&#8217;s grate was crackling in its accustomed
cheerful way. Rain lashed the office windows
at intervals; a melancholy mist curtained the
harbour from view. Sir Archibald was anxious.
He drummed on the desk with his finger-tips;
he paced the office floor, he scowled, he pursed
his lips, he dug his restless hands deep in his
pockets. The expected had not happened. It
was now two o&#8217;clock. Sir Archibald was used
to going home at three. And it was now two
o&#8217;clock&ndash;&ndash;no, by Jove! it was eight after. Sir
Archibald walked impatiently to the window. It
was evident that the fog was the cause of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
impatience. He scowled at it. No, no (thought
he); no schooner could make St. John&#8217;s harbour
in a fog like that. And the winds of the week
had been fair winds from the French Shore.
Still the expected had not happened. <i>Why</i> had
the expected not happened?</p>
<p>A pale little clerk put his head in at the door
in a very doubtful way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper of the <i>Black Eagle</i>, sir,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Clerk, too,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Show &#8217;em in,&#8221; Sir Archibald growled.</p>
<p>What happened need not be described. It
was both melancholy and stormy without; there
was a roaring tempest within. Sir Archibald
was not used to giving way to aggravation; but
he was now presently embarked on a rough sea
of it, from which, indeed, he had difficulty in
reaching quiet harbour again. It was not the
first interview he had had with the skipper and
clerk of the <i>Black Eagle</i> since that trim craft had
returned from the French Shore trade. But it
turned out to be the final one. The books of
the <i>Black Eagle</i> had been examined; her stores
had been appraised, her stock taken, her fish
weighed. And the result had been so amazing
that Sir Archibald had not only been mystified
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
but enraged. It was for this reason that when
Skipper George Rumm, with Tommy Bull, the
rat-eyed little clerk, left the presence of Sir Archibald
Armstrong, the prediction of the clerk had
come true: there were two able-bodied seamen
looking for a berth on the streets of St. John&#8217;s.
First of all, however, they set about finding
Tom Tulk o&#8217; Twillingate; but this, somehow
or other, the discreet Tom Tulk never would
permit them to do.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>By Sir Archibald&#8217;s watch it was now exactly
2:47. Sir Archibald rose from the chair that
was his throne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;I had hoped&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the pale little clerk put his head in at
the door. This time he was grinning shamelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said Sir Archibald. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master Archie, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Archie shook hands with his father in a perfunctory
way. Sir Archibald&#8217;s cheery greeting&ndash;&ndash;and
with what admiration and affection and
happiness his heart was filled at that moment!&ndash;&ndash;Sir
Archibald&#8217;s cheery greeting failed in his
throat. Archie was prodigiously scowling. This
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
was no failure of affection; nor was it an evil regard
towards his creditor, who would have for
him, as the boy well knew, nothing but the
warmest sympathy. It was shame and sheer
despair. In every line of the boy&#8217;s drawn face&ndash;&ndash;in
his haggard eyes and trembling lips&ndash;&ndash;in his
dejected air&ndash;&ndash;even in his dishevelled appearance
(as Sir Archibald sadly thought)&ndash;&ndash;failure was
written. What the nature of that failure was Sir
Archibald did not know. How it had come
about he could not tell. But it <i>was</i> failure. It
was failure&ndash;&ndash;and there was no doubt about it.
Sir Archibald&#8217;s great fatherly heart warmed towards
the boy. He did not resent the brusque
greeting; he understood. And Sir Archibald
came at that moment nearer to putting his arms
about his big son in the most sentimental fashion
in the world than he had come in a good many
years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said Archie, abruptly, &#8220;please sit
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe you a thousand dollars, sir,&#8221; Archie
went on, coming close to his father&#8217;s desk and
looking Sir Archibald straight in the eye. &#8220;It
is due to-day, and I can&#8217;t pay it&ndash;&ndash;now.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>Sir Archibald would not further humiliate the
boy by remitting the debt. There was no help
for Archie in this crisis. Nobody knew it better
than Sir Archibald.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no excuse, sir,&#8221; said Archie, with his
head half-defiantly thrown back, &#8220;but I should
like to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir Archibald nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I meant to be back in time to realize on&ndash;&ndash;well&ndash;&ndash;on
those things you have given me&ndash;&ndash;on
the yacht and the boat and the pony,&#8221; Archie
went on, finding a little difficulty with a lump of
shame in his throat; &#8220;but I missed the mail-boat
at Ruddy Cove, and I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The pale little clerk once more put his sharp
little face in at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judd,&#8221; said Sir Archibald, sternly, &#8220;be good
enough not to interrupt me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, sir&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judd,&#8221; Sir Archibald roared, &#8220;shut that
door!&#8221;</p>
<p>The pale little clerk took his life in his hands,
and, turning infinitely paler, gasped:</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper of the <i>Spot Cash</i> to see you,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class='smcap'>What</span>!&#8221; shouted Archie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>Judd had fled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Skipper&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;the&ndash;&ndash;<i>Spot&ndash;&ndash;Cash</i>!&#8221; Archie
muttered stupidly.</p>
<p>Indeed, yes. The hearty, grinning, triumphant
skipper of the <i>Spot Cash</i>! And more, too,
following sheepishly in his wake: no less than
the full complement of other members of the trading
firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company,
even to Donald North, who was winking
with surprise, and Bagg, the cook, ex-gutter-snipe
from London, who could not wink at all
from sheer amazement. And then&ndash;&ndash;first thing
of all&ndash;&ndash;Archie Armstrong and his father shook
hands in quite another way. Whereupon this
same Archie Armstrong (while Sir Archibald
fairly bellowed with delighted laughter) fell upon
Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, and upon the crew of the <i>Spot
Cash</i>, right down to Bagg (who had least to
lose), and beat the very breath out of their
bodies in an hilarious expression of joy.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Dickerin&#8217;,&#8221; Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay explained, by
and by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dickering?&#8221; ejaculated Archie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jus&#8217; simon-pure dickerin&#8217;,&#8221; Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay
insisted, a bit indignantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>And then it all came out&ndash;&ndash;how that the Jolly
Harbour wreckers had come aboard to reason;
how that Bill o&#8217; Burnt Bay, with a gun in one
hand, was disposed to reason, and <i>did</i> reason,
and continued to reason, until the Jolly Harbour
folk began to laugh, and were in the end persuaded
to take a reasonable amount of merchandise
from the depleted shelves (the whole of it)
in return for their help in floating the schooner.
It came out, too, how Billy Topsail had held the
candle over the powder-keg. It came out, moreover,
how the crew of the <i>Spot Cash</i> had set sail
from Jolly Harbour with a fair wind, how the
wind had providentially continued to blow fair
and strong, how the <i>Spot Cash</i> had made the
land-fall of St. John&#8217;s before night of the day before,
and how the crew had with their own arms
towed her into harbour and had not fifteen
minutes ago moored her at Sir Archibald&#8217;s wharf.
And loaded, sir&ndash;&ndash;loaded, sir, with as fine a lot o&#8217;
salt-cod as ever came out o&#8217; White Bay an&#8217; off
the French Shore! To all of which both Sir
Archibald and Archie listened with wide open
eyes&ndash;&ndash;the eyes of the boy (it may be whispered
in strictest confidence) glistening with tears of
proud delight in his friends.

<p>There was a celebration. Of <i>course</i>, there was
a celebration! To be sure! This occurred when
the load of the <i>Spot Cash</i> had been weighed out,
and a discharge of obligation duly handed to the
firm of Topsail, Armstrong, Grimm &amp; Company,
and the balance paid over in hard cash.
Skipper Bill was promptly made a member of
the firm to his own great profit; and he was
amazed and delighted beyond everything but a
wild gasp&ndash;&ndash;and so was Billy Topsail&ndash;&ndash;and so
was Jimmie Grimm&ndash;&ndash;and so was Donald North&ndash;&ndash;and
so was Bagg&ndash;&ndash;so were they all amazed,
every one, when they were told that fish had
gone to three-eighty, and each found himself the
possessor, in his own right, free of all incumbrance,
of one hundred and thirty-seven dollars
and sixty-three cents. But this amazement was
hardly equal to that which overcame them when
they sat down to dinner with Archie and Sir
Archibald and Lady Armstrong in the evening.
Perhaps it was the shining plate&ndash;&ndash;perhaps it was
Lady Armstrong&#8217;s sweet beauty&ndash;&ndash;perhaps it was
Sir Archibald&#8217;s jokes&ndash;&ndash;perhaps it was Archie
Armstrong&#8217;s Eton jacket and perfectly immaculate
appearance&ndash;&ndash;perhaps it was the presence
of his jolly tutor&ndash;&ndash;perhaps it was the glitter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
snowy whiteness and glorious bounty of the
table spread before them&ndash;&ndash;but there was nothing
in the whole wide world to equal the astonishment
of the crew of the <i>Spot Cash</i>&ndash;&ndash;nothing to
approach it, indeed&ndash;&ndash;except their fine delight.</p>
